Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at the Singapore Expo.He was among the 632 new COVID-19 cases reported on Tuesday. Singapore has confirmed 19,410 cases of the disease so far.The 20-year-old nurse is the third confirmed case working in the public healthcare sector that is linked to the Singapore Expo facility.A 52-year-old Singaporean woman, who was a healthcare volunteer at the facility, tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. Last Saturday, a 34-year-old nurse employed by the Health Promotion Board and deployed to the Singapore Expo was confirmed to have the coronavirus.The community care facility houses both recovering patients and “early” patients, who are confirmed to have COVID-19 but are mostly well.Such community facilities have helped shift patient load away from hospitals, housing the majority of all COVID-19 patients in Singapore.These facilities, situated in places like Singapore Expo, Changi Exhibition Centre and D’Resort in Pasir Ris, are for coronavirus patients with mild symptoms and lower risk factors.As of Apr 26, there have been 66 COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers and support staff, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday. Of these, 46 have had direct contact with patients.He was responding to chairman of Government Parliamentary Committee for Health Dr Chia Shi-Lu, who asked how many healthcare workers have been infected by the COVID-19 virus and how many have been infected in their line of duty.Mr Gan added that healthcare workers have taken extra level of care at their workplaces to protect themselves and their families.“Nevertheless, in the event that our healthcare workers fall sick, we will ensure that they are well taken care of. Under such unfortunate circumstances, our institutions stay in touch with infected healthcare workers to check-in on their general well-being,” he said."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Imagine, if you can, waking up every day racked with fear that your spouse could lash out anytime he gets triggered by something he disagrees with, even if it has nothing to do with you.For instance, the rising number of COVID-19 cases.And you absorb the verbal abuse quietly, making yourself small — even though life would be easier if you could be invisible instead.For the past 13 years, that has been Mdm Tan’s reality. And her husband’s slurs have only got worse since the “circuit breaker” kicked in on Apr 7.At first, she worked from home before realising, after two days, she could not focus with his badgering. Despite being unemployed, he also “expected (her) to care for the children instead of working”, while he “just sat in front of the computer”.Since then, she leaves for work every day, while he remains in their four-room flat with their two daughters, aged five and nine.During this time, he watches “the global situation, like China, Wuhan, Hubei” and takes note of “how many people die, how they suffer”. Then he uses this information as a reason to rage at her.“He tells me, ‘Oh, see the kids. You don’t care. How come you’re not worried at all? If you want to die, you go and die. You don’t have any concern. You’re too complacent.’ Things like that,” said Tan over the phone.“He’d say I want to ... harm the kids, like I’m trying to die and make them die together with me by not observing strict hygiene practices.”Tan’s husband was referring to wearing masks, which was not compulsory at the start of the circuit breaker.Whenever he erupts into his usual “aggressive” tirade, she “keeps quiet” or “tries not to react so much”. She is used to walking on eggshells around him because she cannot predict what will trigger him or when his abuse will turn physical, as it has previously.Like the other domestic abuse victims who spoke with CNA Insider, she requested anonymity to protect herself from her abuser’s potential wrath.As reported on Apr 23, the Social and Family Development Ministry saw a 14 per cent increase in enquiries related to domestic conflicts and violence within the first two weeks of the circuit breaker, compared with the two weeks prior.Family violence specialist centres and PAVE Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection saw a 37 per cent increase.The ministry stated that the increase could be due to “heightened vigilance and reporting”, and not necessarily incidents of violence.But as Tan knows, violence often does not immediately begin with physical abuse.PYSCHOLOGICAL ABUSE ‘EASIER TO ENFORCE’The “climate” of domestic abuse has changed, according to senior social worker Yet Tun Hoong, 42, the manager of a family service centre under Viriya Community Services.“This is no longer the era where people just use (physical) violence. They use other ways, such as financial control, psychological and emotional control, and even social control, which includes tracking who you talk to on your phone,” he said.Tan cannot recall the precise moment her husband began his verbal abuse 13 years ago, but she believes it happened around the time he was trying to complete a thesis for his master’s.His experiment was stuck, and he could not get the data, igniting his bad moods. He started “talking louder”, using vulgarities and calling her “hopeless” and “helpless”. As he did this, he would come “very near” to her, making her feel uncomfortable.“He asked what would happen to our children when they grow up: They’d be like pigs, slaughtered and bullied by others — (they’d be) worse than me,” she said.He said he was ruined because he met me, ‘I’m rubbish’ ... He can’t contribute anything constructive. He just nags and scolds.In addition, he tried to control her “more and more”, beginning with her dressing, and then her make-up, how she talked to people, what happened in her workplace and how she spent her money, even her supermarket purchases.During this circuit breaker, these psychological methods of abuse are easier to enforce when victims are holed up with their abuser, usually in a “living space that’s not too big”, said Yet.“When the abuser is angry and trying to find trouble, they don’t need to physically hurt the victim. They can smash things, hurl verbal abuse and not give (the victim) peace of mind when they’re working from home.”That has been the case with Tan’s husband.“He’ll smash whatever things are available, usually from my dressing table, like cosmetic bottles or even shampoo bottles from the bathroom. He’d throw or bang (the bottle) on the table so it gets out of shape,” said Tan.“He has also punched the computer screen and light switch.”Moreover, the stereotype that victims are homemakers does not hold any more. And with their work-from-home arrangements, being in the same space as their abuser affects their career. The victim becomes “kan cheong” and tries to “prevent things from happening”.“But when the victims try to protect themselves, that’s when (the abuse) escalates and it becomes physical,” said Yet.Around 10 years ago, Tan’s husband started to kick her, punch her shoulders and arms, and use a stick to hit her back. Sometimes he raises his hand to her face. Once, he also snatched her spectacles and her phone.He does not subject their daughters to the same abuse, although he “won’t take good care of them as well”.For instance, he once monopolised the computer, even though they needed it to do their work. And on the first day Tan went to work, he let them eat only at night, as he “had a backache” during the day.To protect them when she is not around, she has advised them to “stay in the room and keep quiet” if they notice their father getting angry, for example if he is “banging the table”.WHEN MENTAL ILLNESS IS INVOLVEDEven if a family has no history of outright violence, the circuit breaker could create friction between members and cause tempers to flare.For those diagnosed with mental disorders, their conditions could be exacerbated. This includes abusers themselves, who may act out further.Prior to the circuit breaker, 45-year-old Catherine Chan was “mentally abused” by her brother, who is 48 and suffers from borderline personality disorder as well as antisocial personality disorder.The siblings used to live together “in the early stages of his illness”, but when she bought her own place at 35, his “mental condition started to manifest”.He would “ask (her) for money repeatedly” and “dial (her) handphone non-stop … threatening to self-harm, like jump from a building or commit a crime, or threaten to harm (her) or (their) parents” if she refused to comply.Since the circuit breaker started, his threats of suicide have got more frequent, among other things.“Lately, I think there’s this video of someone throwing things down an HDB (block). He sent me that and told me he felt like doing that,” said Chan.“He has no contact with humans because of the isolation. His interpretation of the world is very much what he sees on TV and what you get from social media, which might not be all true.“My (main) concern is what his mind is telling him. He expresses that he’s tired because he doesn’t know how to manage our world.”He has begun bombarding her with calls and “10 to 20 messages” daily about the government’s “COVID-19 schemes” and “how much money he can get”.When she tries to help him understand which criteria he does not meet, he cannot accept what she says. For example, he does not qualify for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, as he is unemployed and receives ComCare assistance.“I tried to explain to him that he needs to produce documents ... But he just said all rules are man-made. He started yelling and cursing, so I just told him that we’d talk when he calms down,” said Chan.“I’m used to him scolding all the ‘F’ and C’ words at me when he doesn’t get the money. Basically, he wants to hear what he wants to hear.”In such instances, she cools off by not responding to him for a while, although he sends her his questions via WhatsApp once he knows she is ignoring him. She replies only if it is a “simple yes or no”.When he threatens to self-harm or harm others, she gives feedback to his caseworker from the Institute of Mental Health instead.For now, he has not physically abused her, although he has threatened to hit her. She has warned him that it would be “the end of (her) helping him” if he touches her.SEEKING SOLACEChan, who became her brother’s guardian after he got divorced about four years ago, releases stress through drawing and volunteering at Hope Alliance, an organisation that empowers people with mental health issues.By running online meetings and support groups, she finds comfort in listening to other people’s experiences, some of which are worse than hers.On the other hand, there are victims of domestic abuse who simply need a place to stay while they figure out their next move. In this case, places like Star Shelter are a lifeline.Lekha has been living at Star Shelter since earlier this year, while proceeding with her divorce and personal protection order against her husband with help from the Legal Aid Bureau.She has not gone home to their four-room flat, and her husband does not know where she is.“Since the first day” of her marriage, she has been abused. This includes getting called “derogatory names in front of his family while he laughs about it”, and “getting strangled” once, which resulted in her seeking medical attention.“It’s worse when his family subjected me to physical violence as well, since I had to protect myself against more people. Sometimes I felt defeated because I had no way to protect myself,” she said.Whenever her husband’s temper exploded, she would “try to go inside the room to keep (herself) safe”, but this was futile since he often came into the room and continued the abuse.“When he scolded me unnecessarily, I’d ask him why he did that. I felt that it was unfair ... But questioning him agitated him further,” she added.The COVID-19 situation only provided more triggers for her husband’s rage. For example, when she reminded everyone at home to be more careful, he lashed out.At Star Shelter, Lekha was given her own room for safe distancing when the circuit breaker was implemented. She has “a sense of freedom” in the “much more relaxed environment compared to (her) husband’s house”.“I’m not living in constant fear of not knowing what may happen to me. I have a sense of security here. Groceries are provided, and I don’t have to worry about putting food on the table,” she said.LEAVING ABUSER NOT EASYApart from shelters where victims can seek help, the government has established the Taskforce on Family Violence, comprising members from government agencies, the courts, hospitals, family violence specialist centres, crisis shelters and family service centres.The task force will work with social service agencies and non-governmental organisations with experience in family violence services to help families manage stress so that domestic conflicts do not escalate into violence, especially during the circuit breaker, which has been extended to June 1.But seeking help can be hard for victims who might not realise they are being abused, especially if the abuse is not “obviously” physical or sexual.“There are other forms of abuse, such as emotional, psychological, financial abuse, isolation and wrongful neglect,” said Star Shelter manager Lorraine Lim.“These behaviours include making threats of suicide, causing fear, belittling, name-calling, humiliating, playing mind games, guilt-tripping, coercing, intimidating and victim-blaming.”Usually, a trained counsellor or social worker can help victims “look out for signs of abuse” and “assess the severity of the abuse and risks of violence recurring”, before providing them with information so they can make their own decisions.But victims often feel “helpless, alone and totally dependent on the abuser”, said Lim. If they are not ready to speak with a professional, there are “campaigns targeted at victims” and “reliable websites” that explain the signs of abuse.In Tan’s case, she approached the police “many times” since around 2010, but mustered the courage to seek help from Viriya Community Services only in March. It was the first — and only — organisation she sought out.That afternoon when she decided to visit Viriya Community Services with her children, her husband “already knew” she was going somewhere and turned “more aggressive”.“He asked me, ‘Where are you going? What are you going to do? Why do you need to bring the kids? Can you leave them at home? If you want to go, you go. You don’t bring them,” she recounted.“When he began to question me, I said let’s go to the police station. The investigating officer told him to go for counselling ... In front of the police officer, he agreed. But he never does anything. He won’t.”Since Tan still lives with him, she falls back on biding her time. She feels she has “no choice” and sees “no point telling friends”.“My family knows about the abuse, but they’re in China. In the early days, my friends knew too, but no one can take care of or stop this kind of family issue,” she said.I don’t have many tactics to protect (myself). When he’s angry, he’s really angry and aggressive ... No matter (whether) you fight with him or don’t fight, he’d just be violent.“There’s no way to protect myself. There is no way,” she added.Lim, however, believes there are ways in which victims can overcome their abuser’s control.“They have to find a safe way to stay connected through phone calls, messaging, video calls, social media and other platforms. For example, they can observe the daily routine of their abusers, like what time they sleep or ... run errands, then use that time to call a friend or family member,” she advised.Strategising their own routine is also pertinent, so that they are not occupied by other duties during these “safe periods”. If the abuse escalates, these periods could be the only time they can escape their home or call the police.Victims should also share a code word with a friend, who would know to call the police if the word is used in conversation.Having endured years of abuse, Tan encourages those who are suffering in silence to “take action early” instead.“If there’s any change of behaviour out of the norm, if the person becomes more aggressive, violent and can’t control emotion properly, don’t tolerate,” she said. “Don’t wait.”"

      "para": "SINGAPORE: A man labelled a \"menace to society\" by the prosecution was sentenced to seven months' jail on Wednesday (May 6) for verbally abusing police and safe-distancing enforcement officers who were urging compliance with COVID-19 measures.Ravi Sinathamby Subramaniam, 53, had pleaded guilty to two charges of verbally abusing police and health officers and a third charge of threatening to \"break\" the faces of three health officers. Another five charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.Ravi had committed the offences over two days last month - first going to convenience store Hao Mart at Block 64, Whampoa Drive on Apr 14.He was standing in the queue, holding an open can of beer and reeking of alcohol and complaining loudly about why the queue was not properly organised.When the police spoke to him, he turned aggressive and spoke loudly to them, trying to leave and refusing to cooperate, drawing a crowd.He hurled multiple vulgarities at the police and was arrested but reoffended four days later at a coffee shop at Block 81, Whampoa Drive.When approached by a health officer enforcing safe-distancing measures as he was wearing his face mask over his chin and not over his nose and mouth, Ravi turned aggressive.He cursed at the officer and a second colleague who joined her, saying: \"You don't let me see you again if not I will break your face.\"He later told the two officers and a third colleague: \"The next time I see you, I will break your face.\"The prosecution had pushed for at least 10 months' jail, saying that the case \"presents an important opportunity for this court to send a clear message that such conduct\" against frontline officers in the coronavirus fight will not be tolerated.The judge had asked for further arguments on two similar cases as comparisons against Ravi's case, and Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said that Ravi had committed more serious previous offences, including most recently threatening his brother with boiling water and a chopper.\"The intimidation in the present case has to be viewed against the backdrop of the profile of the victims, the number of victims, the number of times he threatened them, the reoffending of the accused within four days and serious antecedents, many of which are violence-related,\" said Mr Koh.He said Ravi has accumulated a long list of offences spanning decades.\"Despite being imprisoned repeatedly, he doesn't seem to be able to remain crime-free for long,\" said Mr Koh, adding that Ravi has even been caned before but \"continues to be a menace to society\".His crime records now show a trend of intimidating behaviour towards public servants, he said.Ravi, who was unrepresented, said: \"I apologise to the court. I apologise to the civil servant and I apologise to the government for what I have done without my knowledge because I am drunk.\"The judge said he noticed that the threats in the two cases used for comparison with Ravi's were \"more serious\", and gave Ravi a jail term three months lower than what the prosecution had pushed for.He also directed a session for Ravi to be given counselling for his underlying behaviour and for treatment plans to be formulated."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Having been running his business at Tekka Market for more than four decades, Mr Mohamed Mustafa Shahul Hamid is a familiar face to those who frequent the market in Little India. But on Tuesday (May 5), the 62-year-old took to Facebook to promote his mutton stall for the first time.“I’ve been doing the business here for 45 years,” he told hundreds of online audience members via a livestream on the social media platform. “It was previously (run) by my father in the early 50s and now it’s almost 80 years that our business has been established.”Showing various types of meat before the camera, Mr Mustafa and his son took turns to explain how the stall sources its produce from Australia, New Zealand and even Ireland.“Good quality. Very nice and tasty,” they said, while dishing out cooking tips once in a while. “Season it with salt and pepper will do because it’s very fresh.”The result was better than they thought, with everything sold out in 30 minutes. Mr Mustafa said they raked in more than S$1,000 in sales.“The support has been overwhelming,” his son, Nizamdeen, said towards the end of the livestream. “We actually planned for one hour (of) sales but it’s now half an hour and we are sold out.”“It was great fun,” Mr Mustafa told CNA on Tuesday afternoon, adding that he had specially dressed up for his first Facebook Live experience.“I’m very happy and of course, I would do this again.”FROM WET MARKET TO WEB MARKETMr Mustafa was one of the five stall owners from Tekka Market who were hawking items from vegetables to fish from behind their phones on Tuesday.Each vendor was given a one-hour slot to stream live from the Tekka Online Market Facebook page, in an event that was organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and creative agency BlkJ.Customers who would like to place an order can do so by commenting on the livestream. Orders will be taken on a first-come, first-served basis.Once confirmed, customers will have to send in their contact numbers and delivery addresses through Facebook messenger, and make payment via PayNow. As part of the event, free islandwide delivery is offered to those who spend more than S$20.IMDA said it wanted to showcase how businesses and consumers can tap technology to do things in a new and safer manner amid the “circuit breaker” period. Wet markets were chosen as they form an “essential part” of people’s daily lives.“We are happy (to work with our partners) to help stallholders learn how to sell online and reach more customers, and encourage customers to buy and pay online,” said IMDA’s assistant chief executive Jane Lim.“This is part of our continuing efforts to help our society and businesses go digital and find new opportunities in the new normal.”With his stall seeing a 30 per cent drop in revenue since the circuit breaker rules kicked in, Mr Mustafa said participating in the live-streaming sale event was a good way to promote his business to a different group of audience.He is also mulling having an online presence, after seeing a drop in walk-in customers due to the virus outbreak.“We want to continue running our business during the COVID-19 period … so we have to think about how we can serve our customers in other means so that they can continue to get their daily needs.”IMDA told CNA that the live-streaming sessions chalked up more than 28,000 in total views, with the highest number of viewers for each livestream ranging from 800 to 1,200 people. A second run of the event has been scheduled for May 12 at noon.But with nearly 1,000 people tuning in at the same time, some commented that their questions about the items on sale were left unanswered. Some also described the “first-come, first served” process as “stressful”.According to the latest updates on Facebook, orders are still being processed and some deliveries may be delayed. Event organisers had planned for all deliveries to be made on the same day to ensure freshness of the products.Nevertheless, there were others who thought the event was interesting and commended the stall owners for their efforts.“You are doing great!” said one consumer after Mr Victor Chia, the first vendor to go live at around noon, said he would learn from the experience and do better during the next livestream.In response to CNA’s queries on whether the initiative could be expanded to other wet markets and if IMDA is pleased with the response on Tuesday, a spokesperson said: “We encourage more store owners to join on May 12. Hopefully it will provide more inspiration for many more markets around Singapore to try out something similar.”SUPPORTING SENIORS DURING CIRCUIT BREAKERThe livestream is also part of IMDA’s efforts to help seniors tap technology during the circuit breaker period, which is in place until Jun 1.For instance, a weekly virtual digital clinic will be available from May 15 to Jul 18 to allow people to book consultation sessions for one-to-one assistance on mobile apps or phone settings.IMDA’s Digital Pod Learning Series will also offer 40 short classes online on the use of social media, coding, photo editing and other topics from May 19 for twice a week.Meanwhile, the sale event at Tekka Market aims to make online shopping “more relatable” to seniors, IMDA said in a separate press release.One senior who tuned in to the livestream was 55-year-old Kendra Ong.“I always purchase my fish, fruits and vegetables from a nearby wet market and I will try to save time by calling the fishmonger (to place an order first) so that I can save on waiting time. But even then, I still have to go down and pick up my items,” she told CNA.Having already tried online shopping for groceries, being able to do the same for fresh produce will save time and help seniors like her, especially on rainy days, she said.More importantly, it is “essential” for seniors to heed the call to stay home as much as possible during the COVID-19 outbreak, she noted.Unfortunately, Madam Ong said she did not manage to secure an order on Tuesday as she was not able to “comment fast enough”.She hopes the initiative can be extended to other wet markets in Singapore, but suggested setting aside a priority slot for seniors.Additional reporting by Nadhir Mokhtar."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Imagine, if you can, waking up every day racked with fear that your spouse could lash out anytime he gets triggered by something he disagrees with, even if it has nothing to do with you.For instance, the rising number of COVID-19 cases.And you absorb the verbal abuse quietly, making yourself small — even though life would be easier if you could be invisible instead.For the past 13 years, that has been Mdm Tan’s reality. And her husband’s slurs have only got worse since the “circuit breaker” kicked in on Apr 7.At first, she worked from home before realising, after two days, she could not focus with his badgering. Despite being unemployed, he also “expected (her) to care for the children instead of working”, while he “just sat in front of the computer”.Since then, she leaves for work every day, while he remains in their four-room flat with their two daughters, aged five and nine.During this time, he watches “the global situation, like China, Wuhan, Hubei” and takes note of “how many people die, how they suffer”. Then he uses this information as a reason to rage at her.“He tells me, ‘Oh, see the kids. You don’t care. How come you’re not worried at all? If you want to die, you go and die. You don’t have any concern. You’re too complacent.’ Things like that,” said Tan over the phone.“He’d say I want to ... harm the kids, like I’m trying to die and make them die together with me by not observing strict hygiene practices.”Tan’s husband was referring to wearing masks, which was not compulsory at the start of the circuit breaker.Whenever he erupts into his usual “aggressive” tirade, she “keeps quiet” or “tries not to react so much”. She is used to walking on eggshells around him because she cannot predict what will trigger him or when his abuse will turn physical, as it has previously.Like the other domestic abuse victims who spoke with CNA Insider, she requested anonymity to protect herself from her abuser’s potential wrath.As reported on Apr 23, the Social and Family Development Ministry saw a 14 per cent increase in enquiries related to domestic conflicts and violence within the first two weeks of the circuit breaker, compared with the two weeks prior.Family violence specialist centres and PAVE Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection saw a 37 per cent increase.The ministry stated that the increase could be due to “heightened vigilance and reporting”, and not necessarily incidents of violence.But as Tan knows, violence often does not immediately begin with physical abuse.PYSCHOLOGICAL ABUSE ‘EASIER TO ENFORCE’The “climate” of domestic abuse has changed, according to senior social worker Yet Tun Hoong, 42, the manager of a family service centre under Viriya Community Services.“This is no longer the era where people just use (physical) violence. They use other ways, such as financial control, psychological and emotional control, and even social control, which includes tracking who you talk to on your phone,” he said.Tan cannot recall the precise moment her husband began his verbal abuse 13 years ago, but she believes it happened around the time he was trying to complete a thesis for his master’s.His experiment was stuck, and he could not get the data, igniting his bad moods. He started “talking louder”, using vulgarities and calling her “hopeless” and “helpless”. As he did this, he would come “very near” to her, making her feel uncomfortable.“He asked what would happen to our children when they grow up: They’d be like pigs, slaughtered and bullied by others — (they’d be) worse than me,” she said.He said he was ruined because he met me, ‘I’m rubbish’ ... He can’t contribute anything constructive. He just nags and scolds.In addition, he tried to control her “more and more”, beginning with her dressing, and then her make-up, how she talked to people, what happened in her workplace and how she spent her money, even her supermarket purchases.During this circuit breaker, these psychological methods of abuse are easier to enforce when victims are holed up with their abuser, usually in a “living space that’s not too big”, said Yet.“When the abuser is angry and trying to find trouble, they don’t need to physically hurt the victim. They can smash things, hurl verbal abuse and not give (the victim) peace of mind when they’re working from home.”That has been the case with Tan’s husband.“He’ll smash whatever things are available, usually from my dressing table, like cosmetic bottles or even shampoo bottles from the bathroom. He’d throw or bang (the bottle) on the table so it gets out of shape,” said Tan.“He has also punched the computer screen and light switch.”Moreover, the stereotype that victims are homemakers does not hold any more. And with their work-from-home arrangements, being in the same space as their abuser affects their career. The victim becomes “kan cheong” and tries to “prevent things from happening”.“But when the victims try to protect themselves, that’s when (the abuse) escalates and it becomes physical,” said Yet.Around 10 years ago, Tan’s husband started to kick her, punch her shoulders and arms, and use a stick to hit her back. Sometimes he raises his hand to her face. Once, he also snatched her spectacles and her phone.He does not subject their daughters to the same abuse, although he “won’t take good care of them as well”.For instance, he once monopolised the computer, even though they needed it to do their work. And on the first day Tan went to work, he let them eat only at night, as he “had a backache” during the day.To protect them when she is not around, she has advised them to “stay in the room and keep quiet” if they notice their father getting angry, for example if he is “banging the table”.WHEN MENTAL ILLNESS IS INVOLVEDEven if a family has no history of outright violence, the circuit breaker could create friction between members and cause tempers to flare.For those diagnosed with mental disorders, their conditions could be exacerbated. This includes abusers themselves, who may act out further.Prior to the circuit breaker, 45-year-old Catherine Chan was “mentally abused” by her brother, who is 48 and suffers from borderline personality disorder as well as antisocial personality disorder.The siblings used to live together “in the early stages of his illness”, but when she bought her own place at 35, his “mental condition started to manifest”.He would “ask (her) for money repeatedly” and “dial (her) handphone non-stop … threatening to self-harm, like jump from a building or commit a crime, or threaten to harm (her) or (their) parents” if she refused to comply.Since the circuit breaker started, his threats of suicide have got more frequent, among other things.“Lately, I think there’s this video of someone throwing things down an HDB (block). He sent me that and told me he felt like doing that,” said Chan.“He has no contact with humans because of the isolation. His interpretation of the world is very much what he sees on TV and what you get from social media, which might not be all true.“My (main) concern is what his mind is telling him. He expresses that he’s tired because he doesn’t know how to manage our world.”He has begun bombarding her with calls and “10 to 20 messages” daily about the government’s “COVID-19 schemes” and “how much money he can get”.When she tries to help him understand which criteria he does not meet, he cannot accept what she says. For example, he does not qualify for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, as he is unemployed and receives ComCare assistance.“I tried to explain to him that he needs to produce documents ... But he just said all rules are man-made. He started yelling and cursing, so I just told him that we’d talk when he calms down,” said Chan.“I’m used to him scolding all the ‘F’ and C’ words at me when he doesn’t get the money. Basically, he wants to hear what he wants to hear.”In such instances, she cools off by not responding to him for a while, although he sends her his questions via WhatsApp once he knows she is ignoring him. She replies only if it is a “simple yes or no”.When he threatens to self-harm or harm others, she gives feedback to his caseworker from the Institute of Mental Health instead.For now, he has not physically abused her, although he has threatened to hit her. She has warned him that it would be “the end of (her) helping him” if he touches her.SEEKING SOLACEChan, who became her brother’s guardian after he got divorced about four years ago, releases stress through drawing and volunteering at Hope Alliance, an organisation that empowers people with mental health issues.By running online meetings and support groups, she finds comfort in listening to other people’s experiences, some of which are worse than hers.On the other hand, there are victims of domestic abuse who simply need a place to stay while they figure out their next move. In this case, places like Star Shelter are a lifeline.Lekha has been living at Star Shelter since earlier this year, while proceeding with her divorce and personal protection order against her husband with help from the Legal Aid Bureau.She has not gone home to their four-room flat, and her husband does not know where she is.“Since the first day” of her marriage, she has been abused. This includes getting called “derogatory names in front of his family while he laughs about it”, and “getting strangled” once, which resulted in her seeking medical attention.“It’s worse when his family subjected me to physical violence as well, since I had to protect myself against more people. Sometimes I felt defeated because I had no way to protect myself,” she said.Whenever her husband’s temper exploded, she would “try to go inside the room to keep (herself) safe”, but this was futile since he often came into the room and continued the abuse.“When he scolded me unnecessarily, I’d ask him why he did that. I felt that it was unfair ... But questioning him agitated him further,” she added.The COVID-19 situation only provided more triggers for her husband’s rage. For example, when she reminded everyone at home to be more careful, he lashed out.At Star Shelter, Lekha was given her own room for safe distancing when the circuit breaker was implemented. She has “a sense of freedom” in the “much more relaxed environment compared to (her) husband’s house”.“I’m not living in constant fear of not knowing what may happen to me. I have a sense of security here. Groceries are provided, and I don’t have to worry about putting food on the table,” she said.LEAVING ABUSER NOT EASYApart from shelters where victims can seek help, the government has established the Taskforce on Family Violence, comprising members from government agencies, the courts, hospitals, family violence specialist centres, crisis shelters and family service centres.The task force will work with social service agencies and non-governmental organisations with experience in family violence services to help families manage stress so that domestic conflicts do not escalate into violence, especially during the circuit breaker, which has been extended to June 1.But seeking help can be hard for victims who might not realise they are being abused, especially if the abuse is not “obviously” physical or sexual.“There are other forms of abuse, such as emotional, psychological, financial abuse, isolation and wrongful neglect,” said Star Shelter manager Lorraine Lim.“These behaviours include making threats of suicide, causing fear, belittling, name-calling, humiliating, playing mind games, guilt-tripping, coercing, intimidating and victim-blaming.”Usually, a trained counsellor or social worker can help victims “look out for signs of abuse” and “assess the severity of the abuse and risks of violence recurring”, before providing them with information so they can make their own decisions.But victims often feel “helpless, alone and totally dependent on the abuser”, said Lim. If they are not ready to speak with a professional, there are “campaigns targeted at victims” and “reliable websites” that explain the signs of abuse.In Tan’s case, she approached the police “many times” since around 2010, but mustered the courage to seek help from Viriya Community Services only in March. It was the first — and only — organisation she sought out.That afternoon when she decided to visit Viriya Community Services with her children, her husband “already knew” she was going somewhere and turned “more aggressive”.“He asked me, ‘Where are you going? What are you going to do? Why do you need to bring the kids? Can you leave them at home? If you want to go, you go. You don’t bring them,” she recounted.“When he began to question me, I said let’s go to the police station. The investigating officer told him to go for counselling ... In front of the police officer, he agreed. But he never does anything. He won’t.”Since Tan still lives with him, she falls back on biding her time. She feels she has “no choice” and sees “no point telling friends”.“My family knows about the abuse, but they’re in China. In the early days, my friends knew too, but no one can take care of or stop this kind of family issue,” she said.I don’t have many tactics to protect (myself). When he’s angry, he’s really angry and aggressive ... No matter (whether) you fight with him or don’t fight, he’d just be violent.“There’s no way to protect myself. There is no way,” she added.Lim, however, believes there are ways in which victims can overcome their abuser’s control.“They have to find a safe way to stay connected through phone calls, messaging, video calls, social media and other platforms. For example, they can observe the daily routine of their abusers, like what time they sleep or ... run errands, then use that time to call a friend or family member,” she advised.Strategising their own routine is also pertinent, so that they are not occupied by other duties during these “safe periods”. If the abuse escalates, these periods could be the only time they can escape their home or call the police.Victims should also share a code word with a friend, who would know to call the police if the word is used in conversation.Having endured years of abuse, Tan encourages those who are suffering in silence to “take action early” instead.“If there’s any change of behaviour out of the norm, if the person becomes more aggressive, violent and can’t control emotion properly, don’t tolerate,” she said. “Don’t wait.”"

      "para": "SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched a S$1.76 million food waste fund on Thursday (May 7) as part of its efforts to tackle climate change.The fund aims to help organisations subsidise the cost of installing food waste treatments solutions. Capped at S$100,000 per applicant, it will cover the capital cost of waste treatment systems, accompanying equipment like bin lifters and any improvements to existing infrastructure. Companies, non-profit organisations and condominium management bodies can apply for it between May 18, 2020 and Feb 28, 2021. The fund will be disbursed in two stages; the first half will be paid out once the system is installed and running.From 2024, owners and operators of premises that generate large amounts of food waste will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment, it noted. This fund is aimed at helping them adopt food waste segregation and treatment methods ahead of the mandatory requirements. In its media release, NEA said organisations can also tap on the fund to set up a system that converts food waste into products such as animal feed. Food waste is one of the three priority waste streams under Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, NEA said. Singapore has made “good progress” in reducing food waste, with the amount of food waste disposed of in 2019 being one of the lowest in recent years, while the food waste recycling rate increased to an all-time high of 18 per cent, NEA said.“However, more needs to be done as food waste still accounts for about 10 per cent of the total waste generated in Singapore and its recycling rate remains relatively low.”"

      "para": "SINGAPORE: \"I'm a traditional banker. I don't know tech. But when I landed the role, it turned out to be an enabler.” A leader who heads digital transformation at a major bank once said at a panel discussion I moderated.Had I come from a tech background, I would have operated in the realm of the possible, she added.“However, because I did not deep dive into the technology aspects, but looked at what customers wanted, I could focus on the desirable.”Her embracing of an “I don’t know” mantra struck a chord. These were not words you expect to hear from a seasoned corporate leader.This deeper lesson can be applied to many aspects of corporate life - that “I don’t know” can be powerful words that unleash focus, creativity and collaboration.The trouble is acknowledging our limitations goes against the grain of everything we have been brought up to believe.We were told to study hard to ace exams and avoid not knowing in school.When we entered the working world, we were hired, rewarded, even promoted for our knowledge and what hints of competence knowledge provides.Yet, when we take on the mantle of leadership, this quest to know everything can be counter-productive, even disempowering, in a world of constant change and rapid disruption, where adapting requires acknowledging we do not have ready-made solutions to fresh challenges.Don’t get me wrong – by no means am I advocating for ignorance or excusing lazy leadership. Yet not enough has been said about what is lost when leaders try to be subject matter experts.KNOWING CAN KILL INITIATIVE AND INNOVATIONSteve Jobs famously said: \"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.\"Yet micromanaging is everywhere. When we believe we know everything, we are unlikely to allow others to share their perspectives.This not only prevents new innovative ideas from being surfaced, but also inhibits the professional growth of people we work with.I once coached a leader who was so beholden to knowing everything she could even complete her staff’s sentences. Naturally, her team soon stopped speaking up and went along with whatever she said. Then she complained they were not proactive and did not offer any good suggestions.KNOWING BREEDS CLOSED THINKINGSteve Yeggie, Head of Engineering, Ads and Monetisation at Grab once shared that the key to fast innovation is Grab’s “go to the ground” mantra.Leaders don’t assume they know everything and so are expected to see how things work on the ground and ask questions. Grab also constantly encourages employees to get involved with Grab users, to understand customer needs amid new changes to pivot quickly, he said.When we believe we know everything, we are less likely to ask questions. We tend to talk more and listen less.While talking may clarify thinking, it is listening that helps us learn, discover more information and options, and allows us to cast a wider net of diverse solutions.HAVING TO KNOW EVERYTHING GENERATES UNDUE STRESS As an executive coach and transformation consultant, I work with many stressed-out leaders. When a digital-immigrant leader has to manage digital-native staff and steer the organisation in increasingly uncharted waters, they may inadvertently take on too much responsibility for the success of their teams instead of working in a smarter way to empower staff.As the world becomes increasingly digital, with new technologies and concepts like blockchain, artificial intelligence and cloud computing reshaping our world, leaders will lead people smarter than them, in roles that did not even exist just a few years ago.Trying to cope with this and also aiming to be domain matter experts in a dozen different disciplines can be a futile quest.For too long, we have bought into the narrative of the invincible, all-knowing leader. This style has its time and place, however, its vulnerabilities have been exposed as the world battles COVID-19 – the biggest disruption of this age.There have been leaders who opted to project a veneer of absolute knowledge and control over the situation, like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump, who were later lambasted for bungled messaging, covering up the truth and delayed responses that cost thousands of lives as the outbreak worsened. In contrast, leaders like NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who were upfront about the unknowns, and their plans to mitigate the uncertainty, managed to restore public calm and confidence.Enlightened leadership is having the courage to acknowledge we do not know everything, and the clarity that we do not need to, if we have the right team with the expertise working on it and can count on them in critical areas.PEOPLE MORE ENGAGED IF THEY CAN CONTRIBUTEFacing the impact of COVID-19, payments firm Gravity’s CEO Dan Price faced a devastating decision in late-March: Cut 20 per cent of his people or go out of business. Torn between two very tough choices he asked his employees for help.“I think bosses should always talk to their employees before making any big decisions,” Price tweeted. “They might surprise you with ideas you hadn't thought of. At the least, transparency makes everyone feel like they're in this together.”Responding to him, Gravity employees took ownership of the decision: 90 per cent offered to take a temporary pay cut, and 13 per cent were willing to cut half their pay, enabling everyone to be employed for up to a year or more.Strong leaders know asking for help holds the key to harnessing the combined strengths of their teams, and is not a sign of weakness.Research published in Harvard Business Review shows how people are most engaged when they are able to contribute. Gallup’s study on employee engagement highlights people feel more engaged when they feel their opinions count and they have opportunities to learn and grow.Yet, leaders who feel they need to have all the answers ultimately limit the contribution of the team. Instead, by asking for help, like what Price did, a leader demonstrates he values people’s expertise and creates the space for them to co-create solutions.‘I DON’T KNOW’ BRINGS OUT CREATIVITY AND INNOVATIONWhen you think of the most iconic inventions, the ones that have made the biggest impact on the human race, their starting point was not to build on existing knowledge, but to re-imagine possibilities.Life-changing inventions such as the light bulb, airplanes, even the first vaccine, were initially ridiculed. Undeterred, the inventors went against conventional knowledge.This is an important mindset needed to nurture innovative future-ready teams.While past experience is invaluable, it is also the Achilles heel for most leaders, since it can quash novel ideas and innovative thinking. It may make us pre-judge ideas.Less experienced employees are often the force behind innovation simply because they are less bogged down by what has worked.This was the breakthrough story in self-driving cars. The US government failed to get traction in the production of autonomous military vehicles by partnering with the big three auto manufacturers for five years.So the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency held an open-to-all competition for a self-driving car that could complete a course in the Mojave Desert in less than 10 hours in 2004. A team of engineering students from Stanford University won the US$2 million prize and propelled the first big push into autonomous vehicles.BEING HONEST INSPIRES TRUSTIn a world replete with information overload, authenticity is the currency of trust. Studies support this, including the Million Dollar Round Table Harmony survey which discovered that customers rank “honesty” as the most important trait for financial professionals, above “knowledge” and “delivers results”.The power of candour is further emphasised by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of cybersecurity company Red Hat. “Being open about the things I did not know actually had the opposite effect than I would have thought. It helped me build credibility.”It is vital, however, we understand that the opposite of knowing is not ignorance, but learning.Riding the “I don’t know” train can be scary. However, when we embrace our curiosity in people and things, we tap into a courage to fully unleash the power of not knowing.This invites people to jump in with us. It enables us to fully leverage the power of the collective genius, creativity and passion of teams."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: There is a lot of information currently available online showing the high expectations people are setting for themselves during the circuit breaker.This can be anywhere from working longer hours because the clarity between home and work is fading and feeling that they should come through the circuit breaker with new skills or goals.I have seen many instances where people are learning a new language, coding or pushing themselves to complete fitness challenges.While these are great ways to improve oneself during the circuit breaker and keep occupied, they can also represent the high expectations we place on ourselves to remain productive.Engaging in such activities allows us to feel that we are contributing somehow to our lives because we have been accustomed to the need to be constantly productive and gainfully engaged.KEEPING KIDS ENGAGEDFor parents, these expectations are heightened by the feeling that they ought to be able to support their children in their home-based learning (HBL) curriculum effortlessly.Again, I have heard of parents feeling guilty around their difficulties in teaching their children while also engaging them through a relentless list of creative exercises – like art and craft or social media dance videos - that they receive from other well-meaning parents.Even during the circuit breaker, the race to keep up is real.Needless to say, this adds to the expectation that parents ought to be able to do it all. And if they can’t meet these expectations, it heightens their sense of anxiety.For parents with school-going aged children or children who will be sitting for national examinations like the PSLE or GCE O-Levels, there is immense fear around their children’s preparedness.Feeling the pressure, parents may also set these expectations for their children - ensuring that the kids not only keep up with their academic learning but also engage in new and creative undertakings.PARENTS TAKE THE LEADThe most important thing parents can do is recognise that they play a huge role in their children’s emotional and psychological well-being. Children model themselves after their parents.Several theories in psychology, such as the social learning theory, explain that children pick up on the slightest changes in their parents’ mood and behaviour.Some children internalise these changes and feel responsible for their parents’ well-being.As such, the first thing to do as a parent is to recognise times when you are placing pressure on yourself.Consider what you’d like to achieve for yourself. What are the emotions underlying these pressures?Apply these to your children. What are you hoping to achieve? What would you like them to gain?STRUCTURE IS NOT ALWAYS NEEDEDChildren respond well to structure and consistency. Set a routine and follow a schedule.But children also naturally tap into their creative minds. They do not need structure or learning for that.Psychological approaches will tell you that it is important to allow your child the free time to play and be creative.Playing is not a passive act. Children do not play idly. During play, children think, connect and create.For example, by learning in school about gravity and motion, children think about those experiences, incorporate them into their play and then create new connections.Play, in this view, is just as important as education and is also a form of education.Play also teaches prosocial behaviour and allows the development of imagination and creativity.ENCOURAGE PLAY, NOT DEVICESIt is also important to remove devices during this time. Children may be spending increasingly more time on devices during the circuit breaker as HBL gives them the flexibility of time to do so.This leads to pent up frustrations and restlessness. Research has also shown that notifications on electronic devices can stimulate the release of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in cravings and desire, which can make the use of such devices addictive.It is recommended that screen time is limited and used in moderation.Parents can consider creating a space to play at home; consider placing materials that tap into their kids’ creativity during this time.You may consider leaving story books, blocks, pretend-play toys, puzzles and art supplies around so your child can explore their environment and tap into their own creativity.Get creative together. Art can be so powerful because it makes you escape for a little bit as it puts you in that mindfulness zone.Artwork has been shown through years of research to promote emotional regulation as well as to facilitate the communication process. As such, it serves as an effective coping mechanism. Art can be accessed by children regardless of their age and verbal abilities.It is also a great hack for parents looking for something to occupy their kids for a longer period of time, while giving kids a tangible outcome of their efforts to be proud of and to boost self-esteem.They can actually reflect and say: ‘I did that and it looks good’.LEARNING CAN COME IN MANY WAYSAs adults, if we are doing this ourselves, then we are showing good habits to our children.Take time out of your busy, strange lives at the moment, by doing something like cooking, crochet or colouring with your children.Doing such activities together will go a long way in teaching your children life skills and allowing you to bond as a family.Above all, recognise that this is an unprecedented time. No one has ever had any experience to prepare for this. We are all learning and adjusting at the same time.We are in a huge transition and it is extraordinarily difficult. Be kind to yourself and your children.I can sense the anxiety parents might have about children falling behind, but just make sure they do a little bit, often, so that they are still engaged in the daily routine of learning. This goes back to the importance of routine and also the process of learning, which is made up of a series of building blocks – each at a time.Know that learning is a journey – so there is no time lost. The expectation of continuous learning during times of uncertainty is hard to achieve.A child needs to be physically and psychologically well to be ready to learn so focus on your children’s psychological wellbeing knowing that it is directly tied with yours.When your children feel connected to you, they will feel safe and secure and ready to face the world. When their anxieties are at bay and they can make sense of their emotions, they will be ready to take on new challenges and be ready to learn.Know that they will be able to bounce back, some requiring more help than others, when normalcy returns and when they have a perceived sense of control over their lives.Until then, children of today are learning many lessons – the biggest lesson is that of resilience and that they can and will bounce back from life’s adversities. We just need to be kind to ourselves."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung has instructed that a correction direction be issued to Singapore States Times and its owner Mr Alex Tan over an online post alleging COVID-19 transmission in schools.The Facebook post, published on Monday by Singapore States Times on Monday (May 4) and shared by Mr Tan on the same day, contains \"a false statement of fact\", said the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office on Tuesday.The post said that the Education Minister \"is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools\", said Government website Factually.It also said that \"at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false\", said Factually.Singapore announced stricter measures on Apr 3 to curb the spread of COVID-19 , including the closure of most non-essential workplaces and the implementation of full home-based learning for schools.As of Apr 3, 69 students and staff in Ministry of Education (MOE) schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19, said Factually.However, all but three unlinked cases were due to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings and a non-school workplace, said Factually.“In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs,” said Factually.Schools were suspended for full home-based learning on Apr 8.Before that, however, the authorities had already taken precautionary measures such as new hygiene and cleaning routines for students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, as well as placing unwell students with a travel history, or who lived with family members who had a travel history, on a leave of absence, said Factually.“If MOE had simply closed schools early, say from Feb 2020, we would have disrupted lives significantly, and the impact on students from vulnerable backgrounds would have been immense. “Instead, we have kept schools open as long as possible, while keeping our students safe,” it said.The POFMA Office said the Education Minister had also ordered that a targeted correction direction be issued to Facebook, which requires the social media platform to communicate a correction notice to all Singapore users in Singapore who access the falsehood through its service.In April, the Singapore States Times was issued a correction direction over a post about MOH’s reporting of COVID-19 cases. It was also issued another direction earlier that month over a post claiming that quarantined foreign workers would not be paid their salaries."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Temporary relief measures have been announced for property developers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the \"circuit breaker\" period, the Government announced on Wednesday (May 6).The relief measures aim to help property developers and individuals affected by the disruptions to construction timelines and sales of housing unit as a result of the pandemic.\"The Government will continue to ensure that prices for private residential properties remain broadly consistent with economic fundamentals,\" said a joint press release by the Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Trade and Industry.\"Hence, these temporary relief measures do not alter the other existing residential property market cooling measures.\"PROJECT COMPLETION PERIOD EXTENDEDThe Project Completion Period (PCP) for qualifying residential development projects on Government sale sites will be extended by six months.This includes land that was directly alienated or had their lease renewed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).To qualify for the extension, the land has had to be awarded, directly alienated or had their lease renewed by SLA on or before Jun 1 2020, with the original timeline for the project to be completed on or after Feb 1, 2020.No application is necessary, as eligible developers will be notified by the respective agencies. ADDITIONAL BUYER’S STAMP DUTY (ABSD)The temporary relief measures extend the specified commencement, completion and sale timelines by six months for qualifying residential property developments.Under the ABSD regime, developers have to start and complete the residential development, and also sell all units within specified timeline. If they do not do so, they will be subject to the ABSD on the purchase of the land. To qualify for the extension of specified timelines for both commencement and completion of residential developments, the land has to be purchased on or before Jun 1, 2020; and the respective original timelines for commencement, completion and sale of housing units in a residential development has to expire on or after Feb 1, 2020.No application is necessary, as eligible developers will be granted the extension automatically.Ms Christine Li, head of research at Cushman and Wakefield, said the relief measures are \"definitely timely and very generous\".\"This will give developers, especially the large developments some reprieve as some already have challenges meeting the five-year ABSD remission deadline,\" she said.\"The impact on developments that will hit the ABSD and PCP deadline for 2020 is quite minimum. This is because according to our calculation, only about 30 over units remain unsold across five projects. Even without the extension, I believe these developers have ways to clear the unsold stock in time to meet the deadline.\"QUALIFYING CERTIFICATE (QC) REGIMEUnder the temporary relief measures, developers applying to extend their existing completion and/or disposal deadline will be granted a waiver of extension charges of up to 6 months. This will also apply to other SLA approvals requiring the completion and sale of all units in the residential development.Under the QC regime, developers subject to the QC rules have to complete construction of all housing units in a residential development project within five years from the date of issue of the QC or the collective sale order, and dispose of all housing units within two years from the issue of a Temporary Occupation Permit or a Certificate of Statutory Completion.To qualify for the waiver of extension charges, the QC or SLA approval requiring the completion and sale of all units in the residential development has to be issued on or before Jun 1, 2020, with the original timeline for completion and sale of units in the residential development expiring on or after Feb 1, 2020.Eligible developers can write to SLA’s Land Dealings Approval Unit (LDAU) at SLA_LDU@sla.gov.sg by Dec 1, 2020 to apply.COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTSThe PCP for qualifying commercial and industrial development projects on Government sale sites, or on land which was directly alienated or had their lease renewed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), will be extended by six months. To qualify for the extension, the land has to be awarded, directly alienated or had their lease renewed by SLA on or before Jun 1 2020, with the original timeline for completion of the project expiring on or after Feb 1, 2020.No application is necessary, as eligible developers will be notified by the respective agencies.Ms Li said: \"Even when things start to re-open, we also expect social distancing measures to continue affecting the show flat activities and buyers sentiment in view of the bleak climate in the whole global economy. \"We are of the view that the extension should not be a one-off measure, as COVID-19 continues to evolve with the potential second and subsequent waves or even lockdowns in the foreseeable future.\"The Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) said it welcomes the Government's \"pragmatic decision\" to extend temporary relief measures for property developers.\"The Government’s proactive spirit of collaboration and support also abodes confidence for the real estate industry and help mitigate the impact on the construction sector,\" REDAS said. \"Given that the COVID-19 battle is still very volatile and likely to be long-drawn and coupled with major disruptions and economic fall-out both in Singapore and globally, we hope the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide flexibility to assist the built environment sector return to normalcy.\""

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Authorities have warned that the use of COVID-19 test kits illegally marketed for home use could lead to the spread of the disease. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is clamping down on such test kits and health products which make false claims related to the coronavirus.Since February, more than 1,600 warning letters have been issued to sellers and companies, said HSA in a media release on Wednesday (May 6).The agency has also removed more than 1,700 product listings. Of these, at least 40 were of COVID-19 test kits, offered for sale on e-commerce platforms. HSA warned that such test kits have \"inherent design and technology limitations\" which could lead to \"incorrect or misleading\" results. \"Consumers should be aware that there are no HSA approved home-based test kits; no health supplements or herbal remedies, and no consumer devices approved for COVID-19 diagnosis or treatment,\" said Associate Professor Chan Cheng Leng, group director of the health products regulation group, HSA.“Not only do consumers waste money on these unproven remedies, they may put themselves and people around them at unnecessary risk due to the false sense of security.”FRAUDULENT CLAIMSThe illegal test kits that HSA found on e-commerce platforms ranged in price from S$10 to S$290. Such listings made fraudulent claims like:“positive results may be visible (in) as soon as 2 minutes”“95 per cent accuracy and results within 10 minutes” “diagnose COVID-19 within 10 minutes”HSA investigations revealed that none of the sellers were found to have any stocks and that the sellers would only import them from overseas after receiving orders.\"NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE\"Health products falsely claiming to fight against or prevent COVID-19 have also been targeted by HSA.To date, more than 100 online listings have been detected and removed. Companies, which include Chinese medical halls, health supplement retailers and multi-level marketing companies, have also been warned.In one example, HSA said a TCM clinic sold herbal fragrance pouches touted to have protective properties against COVID-19. HSA also highlighted health supplements such as red ginseng and Hawaiian spirulina sold online that were promoted as being “good for coronavirus” - a claim which the agency said lacked scientific evidence. \"This is not only falsely misleading, it is ethically wrong,\" said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist.\"The public should be wary of these gimmicks. The more impossible the claims are, the more likely it is a dud. Don't fall prey, don't be a victim.\"More than 650 warning letters have also been issued to sellers and companies over hand and body sanitisers. The sellers were found to have advertised falsely claims such as “protects against coronavirus”, “kill viruses including coronavirus” and “stops coronavirus”.Sellers who falsely advertise products as preventing or treating COVID-19 face up to 12 months' jail and a fine of up to S$20,000.Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect a correction by HSA on the price range of the illegal test kits."

Officials did not say whether the fund would pay for or subsidise the routes.About half of the air cargo carried worldwide in normal times flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters, but grounding of airplanes due to COVID-19 has made the market more dependent on freight haulers.The COVID-19 crisis has also forced many airlines to use their passenger fleets as temporary cargo carriers."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Having been running his business at Tekka Market for more than four decades, Mr Mohamed Mustafa Shahul Hamid is a familiar face to those who frequent the market in Little India. But on Tuesday (May 5), the 62-year-old took to Facebook to promote his mutton stall for the first time.“I’ve been doing the business here for 45 years,” he told hundreds of online audience members via a livestream on the social media platform. “It was previously (run) by my father in the early 50s and now it’s almost 80 years that our business has been established.”Showing various types of meat before the camera, Mr Mustafa and his son took turns to explain how the stall sources its produce from Australia, New Zealand and even Ireland.“Good quality. Very nice and tasty,” they said, while dishing out cooking tips once in a while. “Season it with salt and pepper will do because it’s very fresh.”The result was better than they thought, with everything sold out in 30 minutes. Mr Mustafa said they raked in more than S$1,000 in sales.“The support has been overwhelming,” his son, Nizamdeen, said towards the end of the livestream. “We actually planned for one hour (of) sales but it’s now half an hour and we are sold out.”“It was great fun,” Mr Mustafa told CNA on Tuesday afternoon, adding that he had specially dressed up for his first Facebook Live experience.“I’m very happy and of course, I would do this again.”FROM WET MARKET TO WEB MARKETMr Mustafa was one of the five stall owners from Tekka Market who were hawking items from vegetables to fish from behind their phones on Tuesday.Each vendor was given a one-hour slot to stream live from the Tekka Online Market Facebook page, in an event that was organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and creative agency BlkJ.Customers who would like to place an order can do so by commenting on the livestream. Orders will be taken on a first-come, first-served basis.Once confirmed, customers will have to send in their contact numbers and delivery addresses through Facebook messenger, and make payment via PayNow. As part of the event, free islandwide delivery is offered to those who spend more than S$20.IMDA said it wanted to showcase how businesses and consumers can tap technology to do things in a new and safer manner amid the “circuit breaker” period. Wet markets were chosen as they form an “essential part” of people’s daily lives.“We are happy (to work with our partners) to help stallholders learn how to sell online and reach more customers, and encourage customers to buy and pay online,” said IMDA’s assistant chief executive Jane Lim.“This is part of our continuing efforts to help our society and businesses go digital and find new opportunities in the new normal.”With his stall seeing a 30 per cent drop in revenue since the circuit breaker rules kicked in, Mr Mustafa said participating in the live-streaming sale event was a good way to promote his business to a different group of audience.He is also mulling having an online presence, after seeing a drop in walk-in customers due to the virus outbreak.“We want to continue running our business during the COVID-19 period … so we have to think about how we can serve our customers in other means so that they can continue to get their daily needs.”IMDA told CNA that the live-streaming sessions chalked up more than 28,000 in total views, with the highest number of viewers for each livestream ranging from 800 to 1,200 people. A second run of the event has been scheduled for May 12 at noon.But with nearly 1,000 people tuning in at the same time, some commented that their questions about the items on sale were left unanswered. Some also described the “first-come, first served” process as “stressful”.According to the latest updates on Facebook, orders are still being processed and some deliveries may be delayed. Event organisers had planned for all deliveries to be made on the same day to ensure freshness of the products.Nevertheless, there were others who thought the event was interesting and commended the stall owners for their efforts.“You are doing great!” said one consumer after Mr Victor Chia, the first vendor to go live at around noon, said he would learn from the experience and do better during the next livestream.In response to CNA’s queries on whether the initiative could be expanded to other wet markets and if IMDA is pleased with the response on Tuesday, a spokesperson said: “We encourage more store owners to join on May 12. Hopefully it will provide more inspiration for many more markets around Singapore to try out something similar.”SUPPORTING SENIORS DURING CIRCUIT BREAKERThe livestream is also part of IMDA’s efforts to help seniors tap technology during the circuit breaker period, which is in place until Jun 1.For instance, a weekly virtual digital clinic will be available from May 15 to Jul 18 to allow people to book consultation sessions for one-to-one assistance on mobile apps or phone settings.IMDA’s Digital Pod Learning Series will also offer 40 short classes online on the use of social media, coding, photo editing and other topics from May 19 for twice a week.Meanwhile, the sale event at Tekka Market aims to make online shopping “more relatable” to seniors, IMDA said in a separate press release.One senior who tuned in to the livestream was 55-year-old Kendra Ong.“I always purchase my fish, fruits and vegetables from a nearby wet market and I will try to save time by calling the fishmonger (to place an order first) so that I can save on waiting time. But even then, I still have to go down and pick up my items,” she told CNA.Having already tried online shopping for groceries, being able to do the same for fresh produce will save time and help seniors like her, especially on rainy days, she said.More importantly, it is “essential” for seniors to heed the call to stay home as much as possible during the COVID-19 outbreak, she noted.Unfortunately, Madam Ong said she did not manage to secure an order on Tuesday as she was not able to “comment fast enough”.She hopes the initiative can be extended to other wet markets in Singapore, but suggested setting aside a priority slot for seniors.Additional reporting by Nadhir Mokhtar."

Such listings made fraudulent claims like:“positive results may be visible (in) as soon as 2 minutes”“95 per cent accuracy and results within 10 minutes” “diagnose COVID-19 within 10 minutes”HSA investigations revealed that none of the sellers were found to have any stocks and that the sellers would only import them from overseas after receiving orders.\"NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE\"Health products falsely claiming to fight against or prevent COVID-19 have also been targeted by HSA.To date, more than 100 online listings have been detected and removed. Companies, which include Chinese medical halls, health supplement retailers and multi-level marketing companies, have also been warned.In one example, HSA said a TCM clinic sold herbal fragrance pouches touted to have protective properties against COVID-19. HSA also highlighted health supplements such as red ginseng and Hawaiian spirulina sold online that were promoted as being “good for coronavirus” - a claim which the agency said lacked scientific evidence. \"This is not only falsely misleading, it is ethically wrong,\" said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist.\"The public should be wary of these gimmicks. The more impossible the claims are, the more likely it is a dud. Don't fall prey, don't be a victim.\"More than 650 warning letters have also been issued to sellers and companies over hand and body sanitisers. The sellers were found to have advertised falsely claims such as “protects against coronavirus”, “kill viruses including coronavirus” and “stops coronavirus”.Sellers who falsely advertise products as preventing or treating COVID-19 face up to 12 months' jail and a fine of up to S$20,000.Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect a correction by HSA on the price range of the illegal test kits."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is housing about 3,000 recovering migrant workers with COVID-19 in six military camps across Singapore.The Jurong, Bedok, Amoy Quee, Guillemard, Tanjong Gul and Lim Chu Kang camps have been converted into community recovery facilities (CRFs).Operational since Apr 28, the CRFs are for COVID-19 patients who remain well at Day 14 of the disease and do not require further medical care.With Singapore reporting hundreds of new coronavirus infections among migrant workers every day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) aims to have more than 10,000 bed spaces in CRFs by the end of June. This includes non-SAF facilities and is part of a broader strategy to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity.To establish the CRFs, camps that were either temporarily vacant or camps with standalone accommodation facilities that are separated from other camp facilities and have ceased operations were identified.The SAF facilities can take in 300 patients each day, with a maximum capacity of 5,300 patients. Colonel (COL) Chua Jin Kiat, who is the task force commander of SAF-managed CRF camps, told reporters on Wednesday (May 6) that this is sufficient to meet national requirements.Foreign workers at CRFs will be discharged based on MOH guidelines, which state that two swab tests conducted on consecutive days must come out negative prior to discharge. COL Chua said he expects a number of workers to be discharged over the next two days.Personnel managing day-to-day activities on the ground, including auxiliary officers and civilian vendors, must adhere to strict protocols to reduce exposure to the virus.This includes dividing the facilities into different zones depending on the risk of exposure to the virus. Personnel in the different zones are required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) commensurate to the level of risk.LIFE IN CAMPWorkers who first come in are medically screened and have particulars - such as dietary preferences - taken down before being brought to the living area. Technology like infrared fever scanning, information management systems and health monitoring applications are also used.The workers are then split into smaller groups to ensure safe distancing. These groups have designated amenities, like food collection points, dining and outdoor recreational areas, to minimise transmission risks.They are also given three meals a day, access to Wi-Fi and SIM cards, as well as mobile minimarts to buy things like snacks and basic clothing. Roving SAF medical teams will attend to their medical needs at a designated time every day.Beyond meeting their needs, COL Chua said it is important for SAF personnel to reassure these workers that they are well on their way to recovery.“For some of these patients, especially the foreign workers, it has not been an entirely good experience because they are COVID-19 positive. There is a huge element of fear,” he said.“This last step is to tell them: ‘Brother, you’re almost there. One more place, you’re cured and you can go back to work.’ And letting them know we will continue to take care of them.”Another important thing, COL Chua said, is ensuring that they have enough space to move around within their living areas, especially if they have been cooped up in community care facilities such as the Singapore Expo.“In Expo they are in an indoor place, so when they first came to us they were quite happy to see the sunrise and sunset,” he said.Then there are the little things like providing pails and drying points so they can wash their own clothes and ensuring each bed has its own charging point. Workers can also scan a QR code to give feedback on their meals.“I would say that the general approach is one of engaging them with some degree of empathy,” COL Chua added.“I suppose as a military this is something that we have learnt over the years (as this is) how we treat our soldiers.”This involves introducing a sense of routine. For those who are not fasting, breakfast is at about 7am, after which some will rest in the bunks, walk around in the sun or do their laundry.There’s also a morning “sick parade” where workers can report to the roving medical teams to get medicine for ailments such as body aches and headaches. COL Chua said the most serious condition he has seen is chickenpox.After lunch at noon, vendors in PPE will drive food trucks to the entrances of their living areas.Items on sale include snacks, non-alcoholic beverages and necessities like towels and clothing for those who might not have packed enough before being isolated. These items are reviewed based on workers’ feedback too, COL Chua said.Dinner is past 6pm and then it’s the end of the day. “It’s not as if it’s very exciting,” COL Chua admitted. “But we try to make sure that their basic needs and welfare are met.”SAFETY ISSUESWhen it comes to safety, COL Chua said the SAF and external personnel on the ground must wear face masks at all times. Those who enter the “yellow zones”, which include corridors and entrances where workers pass through, must put on gloves and face shields.The living areas are considered “red zones” that are self-contained with all the amenities workers need. “Typically, we would not need to go in,” he added. “We do very clear zoning, and we have very clear rules about who actually needs to go in to interact.”With cases of healthcare personnel being infected in other community facilities, COL Chua said personnel on the ground are properly fitted and trained in wearing industry-standard PPE.“We have a strict training protocol that governs this, and we put all our people through it, including civilian contractors and vendors who need to go near the workers,” he said.“Sometimes fatigue sets in and you take off your gown and gloves in the wrong sequence, so little things like this we just continue to remind our people. We have roving teams that go around to check on this.”On the issue of security, COL Chua said auxiliary officers guard the camp entrances and operate in the yellow zones to enforce zoning measures. The SAF has also linked up with the various police divisions.“In case there is any trouble or anything more serious, the police will be the second line of response,” he said.HOW IT BEGANConsidering that the SAF only had two weeks to set up the facilities, COL Chua acknowledged that there was time pressure to get it done. A total of 600 SAF personnel, mostly regulars, were involved in setting up and running the CRFs.This includes engaging contractors to build large tents in three vacant camps – Guillemard, Tanjong Gul and Lim Chu Kang – where buildings are structurally unsound.For the other three camps with existing units, hoardings were set up to physically separate the workers’ living areas.More beds needed to be added to maximise capacity, and dining areas had to be set up. Mobile toilets were brought in where necessary.After slightly more than a week of operations, COL Chua said the SAF is in the process of handing over management of these facilities to external contractors who operate dormitories.This is because the SAF needs to resume training and its regulars need to go back to their primary jobs. The contractors are also professionals in the business of managing CRFs.“The regulars are trying to hand over processes, systems and a lot of the little things that go on behind the scenes,” COL Chua said, adding that the handover will be completed in the next two to three weeks.“So that the facility managers can continue to provide the same level of care and welfare for the patients.”POSITIVE FEEDBACKCOL Chua said feedback from the workers has been “pretty positive”, based on the chatter in WhatsApp groups that tell them when to collect their meals.“Some of them even openly share that they have friends with COVID-19 who work in other countries, and they are certainly not as well treated as the way they are in Singapore,” he said, describing it as a national effort.“My guys on the ground will feel it even more. You can see real gratitude and genuine appreciation for what the country has done for them.”"

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Thirteen cases of COVID-19 have been picked up over three months, through a public health surveillance programme that routinely tests samples collected from patients with influenza-like symptoms at general practitioner (GP) clinics and polyclinics.The sentinel surveillance programme has been ongoing since 2007, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). It tests some patients with symptoms like fever and cough for common respiratory viruses including influenza viruses.Now, this is being used as one of the ways to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the community.This “random testing” in the community complements other COVID-19 screening programmes and “a few cases” have been detected this way, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had said on Mar 21.“The idea is to pick up cases that otherwise would not have not been detected,” he said then, adding that this could be because the cases show mild symptoms or they do not fit the criteria to be treated as a COVID-19 suspect case. Under the sentinel surveillance programme, about 300 to 600 samples are tested monthly for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, said MOH.Since Jan 26, three days after Singapore confirmed its first imported case of the virus, these samples were also tested for COVID-19. Around 1,200 samples have been tested for COVID-19 as of Apr 28, and 13 cases were positive for the coronavirus. \"There is no evidence of widespread community transmission. Contact tracing is carried out for all confirmed cases,\" said MOH.OTHER SCREENING PROGRAMMESApart from the surveillance programme, there is also active detection of cases by frontline doctors.According to an MOH circular seen by CNA, suspect case criteria include showing signs and symptoms of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness. Patients who have flu symptoms and have travelled abroad, had close contact with a COVID-19 patient or had stayed in a foreign worker dormitory in the last 14 days are also considered suspect cases.The polyclinics and more than 200 GP clinics are also testing all patients with prolonged acute respiratory infection to facilitate active case finding of COVID-19 infection in the community. As of Apr 28, close to 5,800 swabs have been performed on such patients, who have fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius or more, and whose symptoms persist for at least four days. Of these, more than 130 cases tested positive for COVID-19.Singapore is also testing close contacts of COVID-19 cases found through contact tracing who have symptoms, and any patient with pneumonia. In addition, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) is conducting a study that examines leftover blood samples from people who had their blood taken as part of routine care. They have found no cases of COVID-19 up to the last two weeks of March.Mr Gan had also said on Mar 21 that cases picked up from surveillance programmes indicate that “there is continued seeding in the community\". However the number of new cases in the community has fallen since then.MOH said on Tuesday (May 5) that the number of new cases in the community has decreased from an average of 17 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 10 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased to an average of five per day in the past week.Singapore's current \"circuit breaker\" measures may be eased when the number of community cases daily fall to zero or single digits over a sustained period of time, Mr Gan said in Parliament on Monday.MORE THAN 140,000 TESTS DONEThe 7,000 tests done under the sentinel surveillance programme and picked up by frontline doctors are a fraction of the estimated 144,000 tests conducted in Singapore as of Apr 27. Singapore has done about 25,200 swabs per million people, according to MOH’s website.A large number of these have been conducted in the migrant worker community as the number of cases multiplied among them since last month. MOH has said that the spike in COVID-19 cases is also due to extensive testing at the dormitories. Thousands of tests have been done each day at the dorms, which house more than 300,000 workers.Of the 20,198 COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore so far, more than 80 per cent are migrant workers residing at dormitories. Of the remaining cases, more than 1,200 are in the general community, about 600 are work permit holders not living in dormitories and more than 550 are imported cases.About 1,600 are active cases, or patients who remain in hospital, and 1,519 have been discharged as of Tuesday. A large number, or about 16,000 people, are isolated at community facilities as they have mild symptoms or are clinically well. Eighteen people have died so far from complications due to COVID-19 infection.Going forward, a nationwide COVID-19 testing strategy is being developed as the Government scales up its testing capacity to enable Singapore to open up safely, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong in Parliament on Monday.“It will involve more extensive community surveillance, so that we are better able to detect any unlinked cases in the community,” added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force.The Government will also prioritise the testing of higher-risk and more vulnerable groups, like residents and staff of nursing homes and welfare homes, as well as healthcare workers that have high touch-points with the community. It will then progressively expand testing to the rest of the essential workforce and the broader community."

Thousands of tests have been done each day at the dorms, which house more than 300,000 workers.Of the 20,198 COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore so far, more than 80 per cent are migrant workers residing at dormitories. Of the remaining cases, more than 1,200 are in the general community, about 600 are work permit holders not living in dormitories and more than 550 are imported cases.About 1,600 are active cases, or patients who remain in hospital, and 1,519 have been discharged as of Tuesday. A large number, or about 16,000 people, are isolated at community facilities as they have mild symptoms or are clinically well. Eighteen people have died so far from complications due to COVID-19 infection.Going forward, a nationwide COVID-19 testing strategy is being developed as the Government scales up its testing capacity to enable Singapore to open up safely, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong in Parliament on Monday.“It will involve more extensive community surveillance, so that we are better able to detect any unlinked cases in the community,” added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force.The Government will also prioritise the testing of higher-risk and more vulnerable groups, like residents and staff of nursing homes and welfare homes, as well as healthcare workers that have high touch-points with the community. It will then progressively expand testing to the rest of the essential workforce and the broader community."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Kendrick Tay had just completed his masters and was due to apply to be an airforce pilot. But his plans had to be put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “You know, eat already nothing to do,” the 27-year-old joked in Chinese. Feeling restless, the SUTD graduate was scrolling Facebook when he noticed several schoolmates 3-D printing ear guards - a plastic tension release band worn at the back of the head, designed to hold the elastic straps of surgical masks and bring relief from discomfort around the ears. “They were printing them in their own capacity and sending them to friends who were working in healthcare,” he said.“I thought that’s a useful product because healthcare workers who wear surgical masks the entire day will face ear abrasion, especially if the strap is too tight.”However, Mr Tay felt that more could be done if the printing was done in a “coordinated fashion”. He saw this as an opportunity to bring the ‘makers’ of Singapore together - those who are interested in making their own things and have the tools to do so. “We are equipped with the skills and equipment, but sometimes it may not be a habit to extend help to others. But this can be a way to get the ball rolling, for this community to give back.” About two weeks ago, Mr Tay gathered three other SUTD alumni and started a Facebook group called SG Makers Against COVID-19. They posted in other community groups calling for makers who own 3D printers at home and would like to volunteer to produce ear guards. As of last weekend, the group had grown to about 100 makers - extending beyond SUTD students and graduates - ready to provide their hands and tools for service.Its motto? To produce items and solutions that will help the fight against COVID-19.IT TAKES A VILLAGEThe process of making a ‘ear saver’ - as the group now calls it - is relatively simple. First, feed a digital file to the printer and it will melt plastic filament, which is then extruded from cartridges to form layers and layers of plastic, forming the product.It takes about two hours to print five to eight pieces, said Mr Tay. The only challenge the group faced initially was funding materials and transporting them to the makers.With the makers contributing their printers and time, Ms Lorraine Teo, the assistant director for Industry Development & Collaboration at SUTD, joined the group to help with procurement of filament.It was the willingness of the makers community and the kindness of others that gave her confidence in the project, said Ms Teo. “One roll of filament would typically cost about S$38, but when the supplier I spoke to knew what we were doing, he reduced the price,” said Ms Teo.The supplier, Mr Shafiq Ali, said he was already 3D printing the ear guards before the group was formed. He gave them out to his friends who are working as nurses and medical social workers.“When the group started, I thought I could do more - I can give them the material at the best possible price, so that we can get more guards out there,” he said. The 32-year-old runs a 3D printing company, Meka 3D Printing.Even though he saw a “50 per cent drop of business” in this circuit breaker period, Mr Shafiq felt it was important to support the project.“The makers have always supported us in our business and what we do and a lot of these guys are our friends. We didn't really do anything, we just provided what we could.”Another private hire driver who learned about the project also offered to transport materials from the supplier to the makers for free. “I was really very touched, especially since private hire drivers are already badly affected right now,” said Ms Teo, who was prepared to pay all material and transport costs out of her own pocket. “It started small but everyone just kept giving.”Meanwhile, the makers have been focusing on perfecting the design of the ear guard. Their starting point was a design that has been approved by The National Institutes of Health (NIH) of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, but the group received feedback that it is “too large”. “You end up having to cut the excess off, if not it will stick out at the sides of your head,” said Mr Tay. “40 per cent of the material is wasted so we remixed the design to create a Singapore version that is smaller and uses less material.”The current design is 70 per cent of the original size, which allows printing to be quicker and more efficient.COORDINATING WITH HOSPITALS While the volunteers are ready to start up their machines, the group is still reaching out to local hospitals to determine the demand for the ear guard. Ms Lee Siew Yian, who is in charge of liasing with hospitals, said that several of them have expressed interest and the group has already sent samples over. The samples are currently made by 25 makers but once the hospitals ascertain their need and official volume, more makers will get to work.“Everyone can’t wait to get started,” said Ms Lee. “People are really eager to do something.” For now, SingHealth has agreed to receive the donations after testing the samples and they are “very appreciative” of the efforts. “These innovative ear guards can help tighten face masks, and reduce some of the pain behind one’s ears that may arise from prolonged periods of wearing face masks,” said Mr Tan Jack Thian, Group Chief Operating Officer of SingHealth.“As we continue in our fight against COVID-19, we hope that this will help make the long hours of mask-wearing more comfortable for our healthcare professionals.\"The makers will be sending about 10,000 ear guards to SingHealth for a start, but they hope to go beyond hospitals and healthcare workers. The group foresees other groups of Singaporeans, such as those in essential services, who would find the ‘ear savers’ useful as well.“The hawker that I frequent was already wearing tissues behind his ears,” Ms Teo noticed.The group launched a fundraiser, in hopes of raising S$35,000 to cover the materials and logistics of producing more ear guards.\"We are looking to raise $1 for each ear saver,\" the group wrote on its giving.asia page.\"We would like to give these ear savers to essential workers such as cleaners, drivers, delivery staff, cashiers, and food stall owners ... we hope to make a total of 35,000 ear savers.\" The makers will also continue to gather feedback to further improve the product.Mr Tay said one feedback they got was that the ear guards are not compatible for N95 masks, as the straps go around the head.“Especially when you are in full Personal Protective Equipment, you can’t adjust the straps of the mask after you put it on. It may shift over time and it gets uncomfortable,” he explained. “We hope to design a new product to fix that.”“I’m not a frontline or essential worker but I think there’s so many things we can do to help them,” said Ms Lee. “We want this project to be by Singapore, for Singapore.”"

We have a system that monitors the numbers,” he added.A maximum of 325 people will be allowed in the supermarket at any one time, Mr Mustaq said. The management has also put in place other safe-distancing measures, such as tape on the ground to space customers apart at cashiers.  Like at other supermarkets around the country, customers will also need to have their identity cards scanned and their temperature checked, he said. There is currently also only one entrance and two exits in use, compared to six entrances and exits previously.About 100 employees will be working at the supermarket in shifts, Mr Mustaq added.When CNA visited Mustafa Centre at about 3pm on Wednesday, staff members told us only the supermarket and a section selling chocolates were open. On Apr 2, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that Mustafa Centre was a COVID-19 cluster, with 11 cases linked to it at the time.A total of 124 COVID-19 cases have been linked to the mall as of May 3.The mall announced that it would close for at least two weeks in early April, while it got professionally disinfected. The management was also advised by MOH to keep the mall closed for two incubation periods, or 28 days, Mr Mustaq said."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: A project involving the release of specially bred mosquitoes to fight dengue will be widened to include more neighbourhoods, following successful field tests in Tampines and Yishun.From May, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to more than 200 blocks in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok.NEA said in a media release on Wednesday (May 6) that more than 90 per cent of the urban Aedes mosquito population has been suppressed at Yishun and Tampines under the agency's Project Wolbachia.The 207 blocks at Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong and Hong Kah North were selected as the next testing ground due to their \"consistently high Aedes mosquito populations, and hence higher risk of dengue clusters forming there\", said NEA.  The mosquitoes will not be released directly into homes, but at public spaces including stairwells, void decks and open spaces between blocks of high-rise homes. \"MORE TARGETED APPROACH\" NEA explained that the total area of the new release sites is smaller than the test areas in Yishun and Tampines, resulting in a more targeted approach.The objective is to \"test different strategies, to determine the most effective and impactful approaches for future wider scale deployment for Project Wolbachia,\" said the agency. At the Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok sites, the study will \"zero in on selected neighbourhoods with consistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations\", said Director of NEA's environmental health institute Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching.The aim, this time round, is to preemptively suppress the populations.In contrast, the tests in Yishun and Tampines adopted more of a \"rolling approach\", with the gradual expansion of release sites to adjacent neighbourhoods within each town, said Assoc Prof Ng. NEA said that an average of six or fewer male Wolbachia mosquitoes per person will be released regularly. While residents may see more of these male mosquitoes, they will not attract female mosquitoes to the area, said the agency. \"Residents do not have to do anything differently, and should continue to stay vigilant and carry out mosquito control procedures as usual,\" added NEA. 65-80% FEWER DENGUE CASES AT YISHUN, TAMPINES STUDY SITESAccording to data from 2019, there were 65 to 90 per cent fewer dengue cases at the Yishun and Tampines study sites where the male Wolbachia mosquitoes were released, compared to sites without releases, said NEA. In areas with reduced urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, fewer male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were also needed to maintain the suppression, added the agency. Phased field studies have been conducted at Yishun and Tampines since 2016 to evaluate the use of male Wolbachia mosquitoes to suppress the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations.NEA explained that when male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the resulting eggs do not hatch. \"Over time, continued releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are expected to gradually reduce the urban female Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and hence lower the risk of dengue transmission.\" NEA said that it will continue with the current releases in the ongoing Phase 4 of Project Wolbachia at Yishun and Tampines. This involves a total of 533 blocks - about a 14-fold expansion compared to Phase 1 in 2016. With two-thirds of the year still to go, NEA is already warning that the number of dengue cases in 2020 is projected to surpass 2019's figure, unless \"immediate measures\" are taken."

It was also issued another direction earlier that month over a post claiming that quarantined foreign workers would not be paid their salaries."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: While most see mosquitoes as pests, 28-year-old Janet Ong views the tiny insects as sources of information.“The two most common reactions I get when I tell people that I’m a mosquito analyst - the first is that they will think I’m an officer that goes around inspecting for mosquito breeding,” she told CNA. “The other is that they will ask: ‘Why do you analyse mosquitoes of all things? Mosquitos are so small, why is there a need to analyse them?’“For my friends they will (eventually) understand when I have explained, but for the older generation, data analytics is quite foreign to them so they don’t really understand.”A mosquito analyst for the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ms Ong plays an important part in Singapore’s fight against dengue. As part of a four member team, she makes use of information collected on the ground such as as the density of the local mosquito population. Such data is keyed into analytical models which helps to translate the information into insights which the NEA can act on.These insights into dengue risk areas can provide early warnings of a potential outbreak and factors into the NEA’s updates to the public on the current dengue situation. Findings are also used to guide the NEA’s resource planning allocation, such as where it deploys dengue inspection officers. “We have to first identify what are the risk factors that could influence dengue, then these factors will form the building blocks for our model to predict the dengue case trend for the next few weeks,” explained Ms Ong, who works at NEA's Environmental Health Institute. When it comes monitoring mosquito population, the NEA’s network of Gravitraps come in handy, said Ms Ong. Gravitraps are designed to attract and trap female Aedes mosquitoes looking for sites to lay their eggs. “These traps will be inspected bi-weekly and the mosquitoes trapped there will be collected and brought back to the lab for identification of species,” said Ms Ong. “With that we know, in this area, how many female aedes aegypti were caught. Then we can derive an index and compare it across the different areas so we can know which area has higher mosquito population than the others … It provides a signal to alert us of areas that are high risk.”Weather data as well as human population statistics also factor into the NEA’s models.A DESIRE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCEA graduate from the National University of Singapore’s faculty of Science, Ms Ong has been in this role for close to five years.“I majored in statistics so a career as an analyst has been my ideal choice because I wanted to utilise my knowledge and the analytical skills that I acquired to help derive insights from data, support decision making and make a difference to people’s lives,” she said. “This job is more interesting because it's about dengue and not many people specialise in the field of dengue. \"So I wanted to try something new. This job could also make a positive difference because Singapore is endemic for dengue, we have dengue cases all year round.”While Ms Ong does not have a fixed routine - her job is very much project based - she spends most of her time in the office crunching data and running statistical analysis. But she does not mind being desk-bound.“I enjoy the steep learning curve that comes with my job, although its generally desk bound, I am constantly faced with new challenges that require me to explore and experiment with new analytical methods,” she said. “For example, there could be some hypothesis that we want to solve but we can’t solve it using our current analytical methods so we have to explore new ways of answering the hypothesis, to investigate whether the hypothesis is true or not.”With dengue cases on the rise this year, Ms Ong's work remains all the more important. More than 6,500 dengue cases reported so far this year, more than double that in the same period in 2019. The number of dengue cases in 2020 is projected to surpass 2019's figure, unless \"immediate measures\" are taken, the NEA had said in a previous news release.NEA added that weekly figures remain high - around 300 to 400 cases - and these continue to be a public health concern.\"With the imminent threat of another dengue outbreak this year, my output has helped NEA to facilitate appropriate and timely public health response on the ground,\" said Ms Ong."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: There is a lot of information currently available online showing the high expectations people are setting for themselves during the circuit breaker.This can be anywhere from working longer hours because the clarity between home and work is fading and feeling that they should come through the circuit breaker with new skills or goals.I have seen many instances where people are learning a new language, coding or pushing themselves to complete fitness challenges.While these are great ways to improve oneself during the circuit breaker and keep occupied, they can also represent the high expectations we place on ourselves to remain productive.Engaging in such activities allows us to feel that we are contributing somehow to our lives because we have been accustomed to the need to be constantly productive and gainfully engaged.KEEPING KIDS ENGAGEDFor parents, these expectations are heightened by the feeling that they ought to be able to support their children in their home-based learning (HBL) curriculum effortlessly.Again, I have heard of parents feeling guilty around their difficulties in teaching their children while also engaging them through a relentless list of creative exercises – like art and craft or social media dance videos - that they receive from other well-meaning parents.Even during the circuit breaker, the race to keep up is real.Needless to say, this adds to the expectation that parents ought to be able to do it all. And if they can’t meet these expectations, it heightens their sense of anxiety.For parents with school-going aged children or children who will be sitting for national examinations like the PSLE or GCE O-Levels, there is immense fear around their children’s preparedness.Feeling the pressure, parents may also set these expectations for their children - ensuring that the kids not only keep up with their academic learning but also engage in new and creative undertakings.PARENTS TAKE THE LEADThe most important thing parents can do is recognise that they play a huge role in their children’s emotional and psychological well-being. Children model themselves after their parents.Several theories in psychology, such as the social learning theory, explain that children pick up on the slightest changes in their parents’ mood and behaviour.Some children internalise these changes and feel responsible for their parents’ well-being.As such, the first thing to do as a parent is to recognise times when you are placing pressure on yourself.Consider what you’d like to achieve for yourself. What are the emotions underlying these pressures?Apply these to your children. What are you hoping to achieve? What would you like them to gain?STRUCTURE IS NOT ALWAYS NEEDEDChildren respond well to structure and consistency. Set a routine and follow a schedule.But children also naturally tap into their creative minds. They do not need structure or learning for that.Psychological approaches will tell you that it is important to allow your child the free time to play and be creative.Playing is not a passive act. Children do not play idly. During play, children think, connect and create.For example, by learning in school about gravity and motion, children think about those experiences, incorporate them into their play and then create new connections.Play, in this view, is just as important as education and is also a form of education.Play also teaches prosocial behaviour and allows the development of imagination and creativity.ENCOURAGE PLAY, NOT DEVICESIt is also important to remove devices during this time. Children may be spending increasingly more time on devices during the circuit breaker as HBL gives them the flexibility of time to do so.This leads to pent up frustrations and restlessness. Research has also shown that notifications on electronic devices can stimulate the release of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in cravings and desire, which can make the use of such devices addictive.It is recommended that screen time is limited and used in moderation.Parents can consider creating a space to play at home; consider placing materials that tap into their kids’ creativity during this time.You may consider leaving story books, blocks, pretend-play toys, puzzles and art supplies around so your child can explore their environment and tap into their own creativity.Get creative together. Art can be so powerful because it makes you escape for a little bit as it puts you in that mindfulness zone.Artwork has been shown through years of research to promote emotional regulation as well as to facilitate the communication process. As such, it serves as an effective coping mechanism. Art can be accessed by children regardless of their age and verbal abilities.It is also a great hack for parents looking for something to occupy their kids for a longer period of time, while giving kids a tangible outcome of their efforts to be proud of and to boost self-esteem.They can actually reflect and say: ‘I did that and it looks good’.LEARNING CAN COME IN MANY WAYSAs adults, if we are doing this ourselves, then we are showing good habits to our children.Take time out of your busy, strange lives at the moment, by doing something like cooking, crochet or colouring with your children.Doing such activities together will go a long way in teaching your children life skills and allowing you to bond as a family.Above all, recognise that this is an unprecedented time. No one has ever had any experience to prepare for this. We are all learning and adjusting at the same time.We are in a huge transition and it is extraordinarily difficult. Be kind to yourself and your children.I can sense the anxiety parents might have about children falling behind, but just make sure they do a little bit, often, so that they are still engaged in the daily routine of learning. This goes back to the importance of routine and also the process of learning, which is made up of a series of building blocks – each at a time.Know that learning is a journey – so there is no time lost. The expectation of continuous learning during times of uncertainty is hard to achieve.A child needs to be physically and psychologically well to be ready to learn so focus on your children’s psychological wellbeing knowing that it is directly tied with yours.When your children feel connected to you, they will feel safe and secure and ready to face the world. When their anxieties are at bay and they can make sense of their emotions, they will be ready to take on new challenges and be ready to learn.Know that they will be able to bounce back, some requiring more help than others, when normalcy returns and when they have a perceived sense of control over their lives.Until then, children of today are learning many lessons – the biggest lesson is that of resilience and that they can and will bounce back from life’s adversities. We just need to be kind to ourselves."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: A project involving the release of specially bred mosquitoes to fight dengue will be widened to include more neighbourhoods, following successful field tests in Tampines and Yishun.From May, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to more than 200 blocks in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok.NEA said in a media release on Wednesday (May 6) that more than 90 per cent of the urban Aedes mosquito population has been suppressed at Yishun and Tampines under the agency's Project Wolbachia.The 207 blocks at Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong and Hong Kah North were selected as the next testing ground due to their \"consistently high Aedes mosquito populations, and hence higher risk of dengue clusters forming there\", said NEA.  The mosquitoes will not be released directly into homes, but at public spaces including stairwells, void decks and open spaces between blocks of high-rise homes. \"MORE TARGETED APPROACH\" NEA explained that the total area of the new release sites is smaller than the test areas in Yishun and Tampines, resulting in a more targeted approach.The objective is to \"test different strategies, to determine the most effective and impactful approaches for future wider scale deployment for Project Wolbachia,\" said the agency. At the Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok sites, the study will \"zero in on selected neighbourhoods with consistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations\", said Director of NEA's environmental health institute Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching.The aim, this time round, is to preemptively suppress the populations.In contrast, the tests in Yishun and Tampines adopted more of a \"rolling approach\", with the gradual expansion of release sites to adjacent neighbourhoods within each town, said Assoc Prof Ng. NEA said that an average of six or fewer male Wolbachia mosquitoes per person will be released regularly. While residents may see more of these male mosquitoes, they will not attract female mosquitoes to the area, said the agency. \"Residents do not have to do anything differently, and should continue to stay vigilant and carry out mosquito control procedures as usual,\" added NEA. 65-80% FEWER DENGUE CASES AT YISHUN, TAMPINES STUDY SITESAccording to data from 2019, there were 65 to 90 per cent fewer dengue cases at the Yishun and Tampines study sites where the male Wolbachia mosquitoes were released, compared to sites without releases, said NEA. In areas with reduced urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, fewer male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were also needed to maintain the suppression, added the agency. Phased field studies have been conducted at Yishun and Tampines since 2016 to evaluate the use of male Wolbachia mosquitoes to suppress the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations.NEA explained that when male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the resulting eggs do not hatch. \"Over time, continued releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are expected to gradually reduce the urban female Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and hence lower the risk of dengue transmission.\" NEA said that it will continue with the current releases in the ongoing Phase 4 of Project Wolbachia at Yishun and Tampines. This involves a total of 533 blocks - about a 14-fold expansion compared to Phase 1 in 2016. With two-thirds of the year still to go, NEA is already warning that the number of dengue cases in 2020 is projected to surpass 2019's figure, unless \"immediate measures\" are taken."

He is now in stable condition, after undergoing surgery.According to Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Monday, around 1,000 NParks officers have been deployed to reinforce safe distancing measures in parks, gardens and nature reserves. "

Officials did not say whether the fund would pay for or subsidise the routes.About half of the air cargo carried worldwide in normal times flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters, but grounding of airplanes due to COVID-19 has made the market more dependent on freight haulers.The COVID-19 crisis has also forced many airlines to use their passenger fleets as temporary cargo carriers."

I can only pray to God.”But the mental stress of Priya’s work is not the only weight on her mind.For the last two months she has not been able to hug her three daughters who are back home in Perling, Johor Bahru – nor her husband, even though he is here in Singapore as well.He works as a logistics assistant and stays in company-arranged accommodation, while she has been put up at a hotel by her employer. Under Singapore’s circuit-breaker rules, this makes them separate households so they cannot meet, only FaceTime each other.“My husband now is very lonely. We are in the same country, but we can’t see each other,” said Priya tearfully. “Yesterday, he cried. He said we need the money, must stay (in Singapore) for the kids.”A LIFE-AND-DEATH SERVICEPriya is one of 58,000 cleaners here, and she is among the many Malaysian workers who made the decision to stay in Singapore when Malaysia’s Movement Control Order (MCO) took effect on March 18. Like her, many of them have also been crucial to keeping essential services for Singaporeans running.WATCH: Scared and feeling alone in Singapore (3:23)Johari Tapri, 60, works at a medical technology company which has been scaling up its manufacturing of medical equipment. “Since COVID-19 hit, our output has gone up by about 20 to 25 per cent because we are supporting doctors, nurses and those working in hospitals around the world,” he told the programme On The Red Dot. (Watch the episode here.)But while Johari made the decision to leave his family in Tampoi – to be the only source of support for his five children and six grandchildren, all unable to work because of the MCO – some of his compatriots chose to stay home. As a result, the company is running on 20 per cent less manpower.“The COVID-19 (situation) is getting worse and worse. So I think people like us, we have to sacrifice some things to come back to work,” said Johari. “We have a responsibility to the country and the company.”As for Vimalam Moorthy, an operations manager for DHL, his healthcare clients rely on his team to ensure that their medical equipment reaches them on time – and these deliveries have now become a matter of life and death.“One of our biggest challenges is getting these goods, from the moment they are ready to go, to the customers… With COVID-19, we face a lot of flight cancellations,” the 34-year-old said.He last saw his seven-month-old daughter, Samyukta, seven weeks ago, back home in Danga Bay.When Vimalan and his wife, who works in a Singapore public hospital, first heard about the impending MCO, they knew they would have to cross the border and leave their baby girl behind in the good hands of her grandmothers.The alternative was to stay home with no pay. “We thought that it was only going to be 14 days and after (that), we’d be able to see my family, my daughter again,” he said. “But then they extended (the MCO). It was very sad, very depressing.”Vimalan also has not been able to meet his wife since the circuit breaker measures kicked in; they have been put up in different hotels by their respective employers.MISSING IMPORTANT MOMENTSThe uncertainty of the indefinite separation has been a heartache to all three families.It’s been especially hard for Johari during the month of Ramadan, when he had expected to be back home breaking fast and performing evening prayers.But the MCO was twice extended, most recently until May 12 – and even if he were to return home next week, he would still have to undergo 14 days in quarantine at centres provided by the state government. “I’m very sad that this year, I cannot get together with my family,” he said.Priya recounted how her youngest daughter cried over the phone, asking “when mummy come”.“I told her I cannot. I come back now also no use. Mummy would have to stay at home, no money, no anything. If I want to buy milk and all that, better to stay here (in Singapore),” said Priya, whose mother is helping to look after the children.As for Vimalan, he said: “I’m missing out on an important part of (Samyukta’s) life, her growth, and all her changes during this crucial time.”But he wanted to send her a message as a father: “Why I’m here working hard is to provide a better future for us, for you.”In the 5-part series Alone.Together, the programme On The Red Dot looks at life under lockdown for various groups.

      "para": "SINGAPORE: While most see mosquitoes as pests, 28-year-old Janet Ong views the tiny insects as sources of information.“The two most common reactions I get when I tell people that I’m a mosquito analyst - the first is that they will think I’m an officer that goes around inspecting for mosquito breeding,” she told CNA. “The other is that they will ask: ‘Why do you analyse mosquitoes of all things? Mosquitos are so small, why is there a need to analyse them?’“For my friends they will (eventually) understand when I have explained, but for the older generation, data analytics is quite foreign to them so they don’t really understand.”A mosquito analyst for the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ms Ong plays an important part in Singapore’s fight against dengue. As part of a four member team, she makes use of information collected on the ground such as as the density of the local mosquito population. Such data is keyed into analytical models which helps to translate the information into insights which the NEA can act on.These insights into dengue risk areas can provide early warnings of a potential outbreak and factors into the NEA’s updates to the public on the current dengue situation. Findings are also used to guide the NEA’s resource planning allocation, such as where it deploys dengue inspection officers. “We have to first identify what are the risk factors that could influence dengue, then these factors will form the building blocks for our model to predict the dengue case trend for the next few weeks,” explained Ms Ong, who works at NEA's Environmental Health Institute. When it comes monitoring mosquito population, the NEA’s network of Gravitraps come in handy, said Ms Ong. Gravitraps are designed to attract and trap female Aedes mosquitoes looking for sites to lay their eggs. “These traps will be inspected bi-weekly and the mosquitoes trapped there will be collected and brought back to the lab for identification of species,” said Ms Ong. “With that we know, in this area, how many female aedes aegypti were caught. Then we can derive an index and compare it across the different areas so we can know which area has higher mosquito population than the others … It provides a signal to alert us of areas that are high risk.”Weather data as well as human population statistics also factor into the NEA’s models.A DESIRE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCEA graduate from the National University of Singapore’s faculty of Science, Ms Ong has been in this role for close to five years.“I majored in statistics so a career as an analyst has been my ideal choice because I wanted to utilise my knowledge and the analytical skills that I acquired to help derive insights from data, support decision making and make a difference to people’s lives,” she said. “This job is more interesting because it's about dengue and not many people specialise in the field of dengue. \"So I wanted to try something new. This job could also make a positive difference because Singapore is endemic for dengue, we have dengue cases all year round.”While Ms Ong does not have a fixed routine - her job is very much project based - she spends most of her time in the office crunching data and running statistical analysis. But she does not mind being desk-bound.“I enjoy the steep learning curve that comes with my job, although its generally desk bound, I am constantly faced with new challenges that require me to explore and experiment with new analytical methods,” she said. “For example, there could be some hypothesis that we want to solve but we can’t solve it using our current analytical methods so we have to explore new ways of answering the hypothesis, to investigate whether the hypothesis is true or not.”With dengue cases on the rise this year, Ms Ong's work remains all the more important. More than 6,500 dengue cases reported so far this year, more than double that in the same period in 2019. The number of dengue cases in 2020 is projected to surpass 2019's figure, unless \"immediate measures\" are taken, the NEA had said in a previous news release.NEA added that weekly figures remain high - around 300 to 400 cases - and these continue to be a public health concern.\"With the imminent threat of another dengue outbreak this year, my output has helped NEA to facilitate appropriate and timely public health response on the ground,\" said Ms Ong."

We have a system that monitors the numbers,” he added.A maximum of 325 people will be allowed in the supermarket at any one time, Mr Mustaq said. The management has also put in place other safe-distancing measures, such as tape on the ground to space customers apart at cashiers.  Like at other supermarkets around the country, customers will also need to have their identity cards scanned and their temperature checked, he said. There is currently also only one entrance and two exits in use, compared to six entrances and exits previously.About 100 employees will be working at the supermarket in shifts, Mr Mustaq added.When CNA visited Mustafa Centre at about 3pm on Wednesday, staff members told us only the supermarket and a section selling chocolates were open. On Apr 2, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that Mustafa Centre was a COVID-19 cluster, with 11 cases linked to it at the time.A total of 124 COVID-19 cases have been linked to the mall as of May 3.The mall announced that it would close for at least two weeks in early April, while it got professionally disinfected. The management was also advised by MOH to keep the mall closed for two incubation periods, or 28 days, Mr Mustaq said."

I apologise to the civil servant and I apologise to the government for what I have done without my knowledge because I am drunk.\"The judge said he noticed that the threats in the two cases used for comparison with Ravi's were \"more serious\", and gave Ravi a jail term three months lower than what the prosecution had pushed for.He also directed a session for Ravi to be given counselling for his underlying behaviour and for treatment plans to be formulated."

Of these, 46 have had direct contact with patients.He was responding to chairman of Government Parliamentary Committee for Health Dr Chia Shi-Lu, who asked how many healthcare workers have been infected by the COVID-19 virus and how many have been infected in their line of duty.Mr Gan added that healthcare workers have taken extra level of care at their workplaces to protect themselves and their families.“Nevertheless, in the event that our healthcare workers fall sick, we will ensure that they are well taken care of. Under such unfortunate circumstances, our institutions stay in touch with infected healthcare workers to check-in on their general well-being,” he said."

He was linked to the cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall.The man died on Wednesday, the health ministry said, adding that he had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. The cluster at Mustafa Centre has been linked to a construction site and several foreign worker dormitories, including the S11 @ Punggol dormitory - Singapore's largest COVID-19 cluster with more than 2,500 cases. As of May 3, a total of 124 COVID-19 cases have been linked to the shopping mall. More than a month after it closed, the mall reopened its supermarket on Wednesday after receiving approval from authorities. 97-YEAR-OLD WOMANThe 97-year-old, Case 1414, died on Tuesday night, MOH said in its release.

They called the number of the missing phone and Othman answered the call.They traced Othman to his location at a bench nearby, at Block 166, Teck Whye Crescent.When they found their belongings with Othman, the victims asked for their items back, but Othman lied and said he had bought them from a passer-by.He asked them for S$50 in return for the items, and the victims refused. When Othman ignored them, the victims called the police.Before they arrived and arrested Othman for theft, Othman handed the stolen mobile phone to another man, whose identity could not be established.The phone was never recovered, but the other items were returned to the victims.Othman pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, with a third of absconding from court taken into consideration.The prosecutor asked for three weeks' jail, listing Othman's string of previous offences, starting with theft in 1986. His latest sentence was in 2019, for stealing two cans of beer.Othman, who was unrepresented, apologised to the judge.I'VE LOST EVERYTHING: OTHMAN\"I committed the offences because I have a reason,\" he said. \"I lost my five children, my wife. I have three daughters and two sons.\"He said his parents have both died and said he has not touched any drugs since 2014. He claimed that his flat had been repossessed and that he was \"under tremendous stress\", saying that he slept in a cemetery and did not have a single cent on him.He told the court he did not mean to steal the mobile phone.\"My clothing, my trousers, my shirt, my top, all were very smelly, my friends told me I smell very badly,\" said Othman. \"When I went into the rubbish collection centre I saw these trousers ... I really did not know there were watches ... all the watches are spoilt, your honour.\"He said he admitted his mistakes, adding that he did not intend to skip court but that he was in \"much pain\".The judge backdated his sentence to Apr 20, when he was placed in remand, meaning he will walk free on Wednesday.She repeated advice to Othman to follow up with a psychiatrist and to go to a family service centre for his accommodation and financial difficulties."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Suicide rates in Singapore were reported to be 8.36 deaths per 100,000 Singapore residents last year.According to the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), this is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 to 29.  This is a 10 per cent increase from 2017.There is a high chance that the figures will continue to rise.While the effects of COVID-19 on the collective mental health have yet to be studied systematically, psychosocial repercussions of the pandemic are already felt worldwide.The US saw a 338 per cent increase in call volume to the Disaster Distress Helpline, a sub-network of America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, in March compared to the previous month.Researchers Lu Dong and Jennifer Bouey from the RAND Corporation found that China has reported “a heightened public mental health crisis” sparked by the outbreak despite emergency psychological crisis interventions proposed by the National Health Commission of China.In Singapore, organisations such as SOS, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and Fei Yue Community Services have seen spikes in the number of people calling in the last month seeking assistance for distress.  The SOS reported that it received 3,826 calls in March, 23 per cent more than it received during the same month last year.GAPS IN OUR MENTAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMAnd yet our response to mental health remains inadequate.Gaps in our mental healthcare system were brought up even before COVID-19 led to the circuit breaker period. Accessibility, affordability and inclusiveness of professional services were particularly highlighted during the Parliamentary debate on the Ministry of Health’s budget in March.We also face a lack of trained professionals. The national average of 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists for every 100,000 people in Singapore is lower than the 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 recorded by most OECD countries.Mental health support offered at the national level did not seem to keep up in tandem with the increasing numbers of those seeking help.Singapore’s total expenditure on mental health made up only 3 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s operating expenditure for 2017, according to latest data shared by the Health Minister in Parliament in 2019.The insufficient level of resources ploughed into mental health in the past could come back to haunt us. Neither the Resilience Budget nor the Solidarity Budget allocated any resources towards mental healthcare support or research.It also took three full weeks after the circuit breaker first started to declare allied health services - including private counselling and social work - as essential services, thus allowing them to remain open.Even if slightly late, this move shows that the Government recognises the impact this pandemic could have on mental health, as does its establishment of the National Care Hotline. More than 6,600 people have already called the hotline within two weeks of its launch on Apr 10.According to media reports, there were also a few callers with suicidal tendencies, with police dispatched to tend to two cases.But the same shortage of resources can be seen with how the 24-hour hotline is currently run, with about 500 volunteers from government agencies, registered mental health professionals, Social Service Agency-nominated psychologists, counsellors/social workers or personnel who are trained in psychological first aid. From the 500, about 20 to 25 of them are rostered daily to provide emotional and psychological support to callers.This small group of trained professionals daily may not be able to keep up with an increasing volume of people seeking mental health assistance.NEED FOR A COLLECTIVE RESPONSE Perhaps, rather than point out the shortcomings of our system, we need to develop an approach where all of us can play a part in protecting the mental health of our society.As an editor of a book consolidating perspectives from across the ground - from academics, organisational leaders and practising professionals, to individuals with lived experiences and supporting figures - I have found strong commonality in the belief that addressing mental health should go beyond the confines of the social services and government.We have to take steps to give mental health as much priority as physical health for ourselves and those around us.This can help shift mental healthcare into a more preventive approach, thus alleviating some of the burden on the thin level of resources we can access.Rethinking the role of mental health in our lives will enable us to work hand-in-hand with those on the policy front to forge ways to create and maintain mental health support - similar to a community-based care for medical treatment recommended by medical journal The Lancet, with “psychosocial treatments such as talking therapies being offered not just by medical professionals but also by community health workers, peers, teachers and the clergy”.Everyone has a stake in the state of our collective mental health.NORMALISING MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATIONSFor this to happen, mental health issues have to first be more normalised. For starters, we need to openly talk about the challenges we may be currently facing.It is a traumatic period with a protracted disruption to life for every individual. Social isolation offers no relief from uncertainty, fear and anxiety, and can in fact be a contributing factor. For some, it is a strain on family ties and relationships. For those in abusive domestic conditions, it can be a matter of life and death. For those susceptible to mental health issues, COVID-19 can have serious effects on their health and recovery.It is not the time to downplay feelings of fear and anxiety. It is the time to ensure you have a support system and find coping mechanisms. It is the time to reach out to others without shame when you find yourself unable to cope.It is also not the time to call out on anyone who is experiencing mental distress or conditions in any form. Be careful about your language when speaking to others. It is easy to project personal distress upon others unconsciously, even if it is not your intention.That is easier said than done. Despite national campaigns to create awareness, the stigma against mental health is still a large hindrance to tackling the issue. Various studies conducted in Singapore capture a pervasive negative attitude towards mental health conditions. One such survey by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018 found that six in 10 people believe such conditions are caused by a lack of self-discipline and will-power, while up to 50 per cent of respondents would not give people with mental health conditions any responsibility.There is also evidence of the impact stigma has on seeking treatment and recovery. Statistics show a treatment gap of up to nine years for those experiencing mood disorders while 78.4 per cent choose not to even seek help for what they experience.Reasons vary from the fear of being judged and being seen as weak, to losing autonomy and control over their lives.Unlike physical ailments, mental health conditions are not visible. What is visible - the behavioural manifestations of disorders leaning towards severity - tend to break established social norms. Those who do not know what is happening may then internalise the behaviour as threats.Mental health conditions are complex, individualistic and heterogeneous in nature.They also don’t have to be permanent.There are actions we can take to support others. We can proactively question labels. We can have more discourse around mental health issues. We can learn to listen without putting forth our own judgements or offer solutions.We can also remember that we are all susceptible to it, if we do not take steps towards mental resilience.There is an urgency to start. We may not feel the strain on our already thinning mental health resources until it’s too late.While the mental toll of COVID-19 has yet to be recorded or tracked, there is enough evidence of the profound and pervasive impact all around the world.That includes us. If we do not step up now to take mental health seriously, we will be looking at another health crisis sooner than we expect.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramXiangyun Lim is the editor of White, a book that brings together perspectives from organisational leaders, academics, practising professionals and individuals for the first time in Singapore (available August 2020).

If hurt is caused to any person by such an act, he faces life imprisonment. \"This is an egregious act of violence inflicted on a public servant who was performing his duties. The man will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" the police said. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and NParks said in a joint media release that they are \"appalled and deeply concerned by the vicious attack\".\"We have zero tolerance towards such acts ... Any form of abuse or attack on public officers constitutes a serious offence, and offenders will be prosecuted in court.\"They also called on members of the public to cooperate when approached by MEWR or NParks officers, and to abide strictly by safe distancing measures. \"Our thoughts are with the officer and his family, and we are extending our support. We wish him a complete and speedy recovery,\" they said. Safe distancing officers are being deployed in public places across Singapore during the \"circuit breaker\" period to encourage people to observe the measures meant to curb the spread of COVID-19."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Kendrick Tay had just completed his masters and was due to apply to be an airforce pilot. But his plans had to be put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “You know, eat already nothing to do,” the 27-year-old joked in Chinese. Feeling restless, the SUTD graduate was scrolling Facebook when he noticed several schoolmates 3-D printing ear guards - a plastic tension release band worn at the back of the head, designed to hold the elastic straps of surgical masks and bring relief from discomfort around the ears. “They were printing them in their own capacity and sending them to friends who were working in healthcare,” he said.“I thought that’s a useful product because healthcare workers who wear surgical masks the entire day will face ear abrasion, especially if the strap is too tight.”However, Mr Tay felt that more could be done if the printing was done in a “coordinated fashion”. He saw this as an opportunity to bring the ‘makers’ of Singapore together - those who are interested in making their own things and have the tools to do so. “We are equipped with the skills and equipment, but sometimes it may not be a habit to extend help to others. But this can be a way to get the ball rolling, for this community to give back.” About two weeks ago, Mr Tay gathered three other SUTD alumni and started a Facebook group called SG Makers Against COVID-19. They posted in other community groups calling for makers who own 3D printers at home and would like to volunteer to produce ear guards. As of last weekend, the group had grown to about 100 makers - extending beyond SUTD students and graduates - ready to provide their hands and tools for service.Its motto? To produce items and solutions that will help the fight against COVID-19.IT TAKES A VILLAGEThe process of making a ‘ear saver’ - as the group now calls it - is relatively simple. First, feed a digital file to the printer and it will melt plastic filament, which is then extruded from cartridges to form layers and layers of plastic, forming the product.It takes about two hours to print five to eight pieces, said Mr Tay. The only challenge the group faced initially was funding materials and transporting them to the makers.With the makers contributing their printers and time, Ms Lorraine Teo, the assistant director for Industry Development & Collaboration at SUTD, joined the group to help with procurement of filament.It was the willingness of the makers community and the kindness of others that gave her confidence in the project, said Ms Teo. “One roll of filament would typically cost about S$38, but when the supplier I spoke to knew what we were doing, he reduced the price,” said Ms Teo.The supplier, Mr Shafiq Ali, said he was already 3D printing the ear guards before the group was formed. He gave them out to his friends who are working as nurses and medical social workers.“When the group started, I thought I could do more - I can give them the material at the best possible price, so that we can get more guards out there,” he said. The 32-year-old runs a 3D printing company, Meka 3D Printing.Even though he saw a “50 per cent drop of business” in this circuit breaker period, Mr Shafiq felt it was important to support the project.“The makers have always supported us in our business and what we do and a lot of these guys are our friends. We didn't really do anything, we just provided what we could.”Another private hire driver who learned about the project also offered to transport materials from the supplier to the makers for free. “I was really very touched, especially since private hire drivers are already badly affected right now,” said Ms Teo, who was prepared to pay all material and transport costs out of her own pocket. “It started small but everyone just kept giving.”Meanwhile, the makers have been focusing on perfecting the design of the ear guard. Their starting point was a design that has been approved by The National Institutes of Health (NIH) of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, but the group received feedback that it is “too large”. “You end up having to cut the excess off, if not it will stick out at the sides of your head,” said Mr Tay. “40 per cent of the material is wasted so we remixed the design to create a Singapore version that is smaller and uses less material.”The current design is 70 per cent of the original size, which allows printing to be quicker and more efficient.COORDINATING WITH HOSPITALS While the volunteers are ready to start up their machines, the group is still reaching out to local hospitals to determine the demand for the ear guard. Ms Lee Siew Yian, who is in charge of liasing with hospitals, said that several of them have expressed interest and the group has already sent samples over. The samples are currently made by 25 makers but once the hospitals ascertain their need and official volume, more makers will get to work.“Everyone can’t wait to get started,” said Ms Lee. “People are really eager to do something.” For now, SingHealth has agreed to receive the donations after testing the samples and they are “very appreciative” of the efforts. “These innovative ear guards can help tighten face masks, and reduce some of the pain behind one’s ears that may arise from prolonged periods of wearing face masks,” said Mr Tan Jack Thian, Group Chief Operating Officer of SingHealth.“As we continue in our fight against COVID-19, we hope that this will help make the long hours of mask-wearing more comfortable for our healthcare professionals.\"The makers will be sending about 10,000 ear guards to SingHealth for a start, but they hope to go beyond hospitals and healthcare workers. The group foresees other groups of Singaporeans, such as those in essential services, who would find the ‘ear savers’ useful as well.“The hawker that I frequent was already wearing tissues behind his ears,” Ms Teo noticed.The group launched a fundraiser, in hopes of raising S$35,000 to cover the materials and logistics of producing more ear guards.\"We are looking to raise $1 for each ear saver,\" the group wrote on its giving.asia page.\"We would like to give these ear savers to essential workers such as cleaners, drivers, delivery staff, cashiers, and food stall owners ... we hope to make a total of 35,000 ear savers.\" The makers will also continue to gather feedback to further improve the product.Mr Tay said one feedback they got was that the ear guards are not compatible for N95 masks, as the straps go around the head.“Especially when you are in full Personal Protective Equipment, you can’t adjust the straps of the mask after you put it on. It may shift over time and it gets uncomfortable,” he explained. “We hope to design a new product to fix that.”“I’m not a frontline or essential worker but I think there’s so many things we can do to help them,” said Ms Lee. “We want this project to be by Singapore, for Singapore.”"

      "para": "SINGAPORE: For 10 hours a day, Priya Ramadass deep cleans floors, toilets, door handles, and sorts of high-touch areas using harsh chemical solvents to disinfect them – a job most Singaporeans shun as “dirty”.Yet as COVID-19 infection cases continue to climb, the demand for the essential service she provides disinfecting public and private spaces has gone up. Along with the hours the 34-year-old Malaysian has to work.“Now much work to do, very tired. Sometimes I sit down also, my manager, if he doesn’t know it’s my lunchtime, he asks: ‘Priya, please come and help clean the table.’ I must go, I cannot say no.”She added: “Sometimes the tissue people use, I want to throw away, I think I will kenna (catch the virus). I’m scared. I think only of my family. I can only pray to God.”But the mental stress of Priya’s work is not the only weight on her mind.For the last two months she has not been able to hug her three daughters who are back home in Perling, Johor Bahru – nor her husband, even though he is here in Singapore as well.He works as a logistics assistant and stays in company-arranged accommodation, while she has been put up at a hotel by her employer. Under Singapore’s circuit-breaker rules, this makes them separate households so they cannot meet, only FaceTime each other.“My husband now is very lonely. We are in the same country, but we can’t see each other,” said Priya tearfully. “Yesterday, he cried. He said we need the money, must stay (in Singapore) for the kids.”A LIFE-AND-DEATH SERVICEPriya is one of 58,000 cleaners here, and she is among the many Malaysian workers who made the decision to stay in Singapore when Malaysia’s Movement Control Order (MCO) took effect on March 18. Like her, many of them have also been crucial to keeping essential services for Singaporeans running.WATCH: Scared and feeling alone in Singapore (3:23)Johari Tapri, 60, works at a medical technology company which has been scaling up its manufacturing of medical equipment. “Since COVID-19 hit, our output has gone up by about 20 to 25 per cent because we are supporting doctors, nurses and those working in hospitals around the world,” he told the programme On The Red Dot. (Watch the episode here.)But while Johari made the decision to leave his family in Tampoi – to be the only source of support for his five children and six grandchildren, all unable to work because of the MCO – some of his compatriots chose to stay home. As a result, the company is running on 20 per cent less manpower.“The COVID-19 (situation) is getting worse and worse. So I think people like us, we have to sacrifice some things to come back to work,” said Johari. “We have a responsibility to the country and the company.”As for Vimalam Moorthy, an operations manager for DHL, his healthcare clients rely on his team to ensure that their medical equipment reaches them on time – and these deliveries have now become a matter of life and death.“One of our biggest challenges is getting these goods, from the moment they are ready to go, to the customers… With COVID-19, we face a lot of flight cancellations,” the 34-year-old said.He last saw his seven-month-old daughter, Samyukta, seven weeks ago, back home in Danga Bay.When Vimalan and his wife, who works in a Singapore public hospital, first heard about the impending MCO, they knew they would have to cross the border and leave their baby girl behind in the good hands of her grandmothers.The alternative was to stay home with no pay. “We thought that it was only going to be 14 days and after (that), we’d be able to see my family, my daughter again,” he said. “But then they extended (the MCO). It was very sad, very depressing.”Vimalan also has not been able to meet his wife since the circuit breaker measures kicked in; they have been put up in different hotels by their respective employers.MISSING IMPORTANT MOMENTSThe uncertainty of the indefinite separation has been a heartache to all three families.It’s been especially hard for Johari during the month of Ramadan, when he had expected to be back home breaking fast and performing evening prayers.But the MCO was twice extended, most recently until May 12 – and even if he were to return home next week, he would still have to undergo 14 days in quarantine at centres provided by the state government. “I’m very sad that this year, I cannot get together with my family,” he said.Priya recounted how her youngest daughter cried over the phone, asking “when mummy come”.“I told her I cannot. I come back now also no use. Mummy would have to stay at home, no money, no anything. If I want to buy milk and all that, better to stay here (in Singapore),” said Priya, whose mother is helping to look after the children.As for Vimalan, he said: “I’m missing out on an important part of (Samyukta’s) life, her growth, and all her changes during this crucial time.”But he wanted to send her a message as a father: “Why I’m here working hard is to provide a better future for us, for you.”In the 5-part series Alone.Together, the programme On The Red Dot looks at life under lockdown for various groups.

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Singapore residents will be given \"better\" reusable face masks towards the end of the \"circuit breaker\" period, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Wednesday (May 6). This will be Singapore's third nationwide distribution of masks, and the cloth face coverings will have better bacterial filtration capabilities.The Government gave four surgical face masks to each household in February, following this up with a distribution of reusable cloth masks last month.Residents will be able to collect their new masks at community centres and residents' committee centres.For the first time, people will also be able to collect their masks from vending machines that will operate even after work hours. Authorities will share more details at a later date, said Mr Chan.Singapore started producing and stockpiling its own reusable cloth masks in February, Mr Chan told reporters, and with research and development, “new and better” materials have been found to improve on the initial cloth mask designs. Responding to questions about the decision to distribute another round of reusable masks, Mr Chan said: “Actually all the while we have planned on the distribution of the reusable masks because we know that after we distribute the first one, beyond a certain time, we will need to refresh some of these.“And as with all the reusable masks, even though it is reusable, it is not reusable for eternity. Beyond a certain point in time, people do change their masks.” The new reusable masks have better bacterial filtration “without compromising on breathability”, said Professor Alfred Huan from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). “In the earlier version, the focus was more about protecting the community from each of the wearers, and depending on the kind of cloth or material, reusability would vary quite a bit. And it wasn’t really tested for any kind of bacterial filtration at that point.” When asked if Singaporeans should stop using the reusable masks that were distributed last month, Prof Huan responded that they “would still be effective” in preventing the wearer's droplets from being transmitted outwards. “The second-generation masks have added bacterial filtration. So obviously, if someone is concerned about walking into an area where there is potentially a lot of viral load, then he could be using that second mask, and it will be more effective in offering him some way of protection.“I hesitate to give any clear examples of whether you should be still using the first-generation masks. But the principle by which it's stopping community spread, I think the first generation masks are useful. (They) can still be used as long as you know there are no tears and wear of the fabric.”Noting research by A*STAR that shows the reusable cloth masks protect people by preventing saliva and droplets from infecting others, Mr Chan said: “That strategy of using a cloth mask works if all of us mask up together.” A*STAR is working with local textile and apparel manufacturer Ramatex to produce the new reusable face masks, they said in a joint media release on Wednesday, adding that production began in April. The masks can be hand washed with mild detergent and fully air-dried. \"This can be done up to 30 times while maintaining its integrity,\" they added. The breathability of the masks was also optimised to be comparable with medical masks.In addition, the mask's duck beak design reduces the components needed, such as the metal nose bridge typically found in disposable masks, said the agency.  LOCAL PRODUCTION OF SURGICAL MASKSThe local production of surgical masks was also restarted in February, Mr Chan said, with the help of Innosparks at ST Engineering.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore was only involved in the production of N95 masks.For surgical masks, Singapore typically works with overseas partners to produce them. The country always had plans in place in the event that a supplier is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations, Mr Chan said.When one foreign supplier was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations during the COVID-19 outbreak, the local production capabilities for surgical masks were restarted, he added.With export restrictions constantly changing amid the coronavirus pandemic, diversifying and looking for new supply lines was a “daily exercise”. “I must give credit to many of the workers working behind the scenes. It’s really their tenacity and creativity that allowed them to bring back the masks to Singapore,” said Mr Chan.For example, some purchasers had to visit other countries and factories overseas, pay for the masks in cash, and guard the masks to make sure they are loaded on the trailers, planes and ships, he added. The locally produced surgical masks will go towards Singapore’s healthcare system.Surgical masks available to the public will continue to be sourced from multiple countries, said Mr Chan. While the Trade and Industry Minister declined to share the exact production capacity for masks, the Government is confident in supplying the masks for local healthcare needs “for quite some time”. Mr Gareth Tang, who heads Innosparks, said the team’s aim is to eventually supply masks for the whole healthcare system, and it is “largely on track” to do that. “We have started mask fitting exercises at the hospitals at the frontline, and started forwarding our goods to the frontline as well.” Thanking businesses and small and medium enterprises who came forward to offer help to start production lines in Singapore, Mr Chan said: “The common challenge for all of us in this pandemic is to make sure that we are able to secure the raw materials (for the masks).” "

      "para": "SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is housing about 3,000 recovering migrant workers with COVID-19 in six military camps across Singapore.The Jurong, Bedok, Amoy Quee, Guillemard, Tanjong Gul and Lim Chu Kang camps have been converted into community recovery facilities (CRFs).Operational since Apr 28, the CRFs are for COVID-19 patients who remain well at Day 14 of the disease and do not require further medical care.With Singapore reporting hundreds of new coronavirus infections among migrant workers every day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) aims to have more than 10,000 bed spaces in CRFs by the end of June. This includes non-SAF facilities and is part of a broader strategy to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity.To establish the CRFs, camps that were either temporarily vacant or camps with standalone accommodation facilities that are separated from other camp facilities and have ceased operations were identified.The SAF facilities can take in 300 patients each day, with a maximum capacity of 5,300 patients. Colonel (COL) Chua Jin Kiat, who is the task force commander of SAF-managed CRF camps, told reporters on Wednesday (May 6) that this is sufficient to meet national requirements.Foreign workers at CRFs will be discharged based on MOH guidelines, which state that two swab tests conducted on consecutive days must come out negative prior to discharge. COL Chua said he expects a number of workers to be discharged over the next two days.Personnel managing day-to-day activities on the ground, including auxiliary officers and civilian vendors, must adhere to strict protocols to reduce exposure to the virus.This includes dividing the facilities into different zones depending on the risk of exposure to the virus. Personnel in the different zones are required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) commensurate to the level of risk.LIFE IN CAMPWorkers who first come in are medically screened and have particulars - such as dietary preferences - taken down before being brought to the living area. Technology like infrared fever scanning, information management systems and health monitoring applications are also used.The workers are then split into smaller groups to ensure safe distancing. These groups have designated amenities, like food collection points, dining and outdoor recreational areas, to minimise transmission risks.They are also given three meals a day, access to Wi-Fi and SIM cards, as well as mobile minimarts to buy things like snacks and basic clothing. Roving SAF medical teams will attend to their medical needs at a designated time every day.Beyond meeting their needs, COL Chua said it is important for SAF personnel to reassure these workers that they are well on their way to recovery.“For some of these patients, especially the foreign workers, it has not been an entirely good experience because they are COVID-19 positive. There is a huge element of fear,” he said.“This last step is to tell them: ‘Brother, you’re almost there. One more place, you’re cured and you can go back to work.’ And letting them know we will continue to take care of them.”Another important thing, COL Chua said, is ensuring that they have enough space to move around within their living areas, especially if they have been cooped up in community care facilities such as the Singapore Expo.“In Expo they are in an indoor place, so when they first came to us they were quite happy to see the sunrise and sunset,” he said.Then there are the little things like providing pails and drying points so they can wash their own clothes and ensuring each bed has its own charging point. Workers can also scan a QR code to give feedback on their meals.“I would say that the general approach is one of engaging them with some degree of empathy,” COL Chua added.“I suppose as a military this is something that we have learnt over the years (as this is) how we treat our soldiers.”This involves introducing a sense of routine. For those who are not fasting, breakfast is at about 7am, after which some will rest in the bunks, walk around in the sun or do their laundry.There’s also a morning “sick parade” where workers can report to the roving medical teams to get medicine for ailments such as body aches and headaches. COL Chua said the most serious condition he has seen is chickenpox.After lunch at noon, vendors in PPE will drive food trucks to the entrances of their living areas.Items on sale include snacks, non-alcoholic beverages and necessities like towels and clothing for those who might not have packed enough before being isolated. These items are reviewed based on workers’ feedback too, COL Chua said.Dinner is past 6pm and then it’s the end of the day. “It’s not as if it’s very exciting,” COL Chua admitted. “But we try to make sure that their basic needs and welfare are met.”SAFETY ISSUESWhen it comes to safety, COL Chua said the SAF and external personnel on the ground must wear face masks at all times. Those who enter the “yellow zones”, which include corridors and entrances where workers pass through, must put on gloves and face shields.The living areas are considered “red zones” that are self-contained with all the amenities workers need. “Typically, we would not need to go in,” he added. “We do very clear zoning, and we have very clear rules about who actually needs to go in to interact.”With cases of healthcare personnel being infected in other community facilities, COL Chua said personnel on the ground are properly fitted and trained in wearing industry-standard PPE.“We have a strict training protocol that governs this, and we put all our people through it, including civilian contractors and vendors who need to go near the workers,” he said.“Sometimes fatigue sets in and you take off your gown and gloves in the wrong sequence, so little things like this we just continue to remind our people. We have roving teams that go around to check on this.”On the issue of security, COL Chua said auxiliary officers guard the camp entrances and operate in the yellow zones to enforce zoning measures. The SAF has also linked up with the various police divisions.“In case there is any trouble or anything more serious, the police will be the second line of response,” he said.HOW IT BEGANConsidering that the SAF only had two weeks to set up the facilities, COL Chua acknowledged that there was time pressure to get it done. A total of 600 SAF personnel, mostly regulars, were involved in setting up and running the CRFs.This includes engaging contractors to build large tents in three vacant camps – Guillemard, Tanjong Gul and Lim Chu Kang – where buildings are structurally unsound.For the other three camps with existing units, hoardings were set up to physically separate the workers’ living areas.More beds needed to be added to maximise capacity, and dining areas had to be set up. Mobile toilets were brought in where necessary.After slightly more than a week of operations, COL Chua said the SAF is in the process of handing over management of these facilities to external contractors who operate dormitories.This is because the SAF needs to resume training and its regulars need to go back to their primary jobs. The contractors are also professionals in the business of managing CRFs.“The regulars are trying to hand over processes, systems and a lot of the little things that go on behind the scenes,” COL Chua said, adding that the handover will be completed in the next two to three weeks.“So that the facility managers can continue to provide the same level of care and welfare for the patients.”POSITIVE FEEDBACKCOL Chua said feedback from the workers has been “pretty positive”, based on the chatter in WhatsApp groups that tell them when to collect their meals.“Some of them even openly share that they have friends with COVID-19 who work in other countries, and they are certainly not as well treated as the way they are in Singapore,” he said, describing it as a national effort.“My guys on the ground will feel it even more. You can see real gratitude and genuine appreciation for what the country has done for them.”"

He is now in stable condition, after undergoing surgery.According to Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Monday, around 1,000 NParks officers have been deployed to reinforce safe distancing measures in parks, gardens and nature reserves. "

Across the region, around 19,000 staff members are working from home.UOB said that as of end-March, outstanding oil and gas (O&G) loans stood at S$10.2 billion, representing 3.6 per cent of total loans, as compared with 4.7 per cent on Jun 30, 2018.Three-quarters of its O&G exposure is to downstream players and traders, of which 70 per cent are national oil companies and global firms. The remaining exposure is mainly short-term structured exposure, it added.Upstream exposure is mainly to national and international oil companies.DBS last week reported a 29 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit for the first quarter to S$1.17 billion."

Across the region, around 19,000 staff members are working from home.UOB said that as of end-March, outstanding oil and gas (O&G) loans stood at S$10.2 billion, representing 3.6 per cent of total loans, as compared with 4.7 per cent on Jun 30, 2018.Three-quarters of its O&G exposure is to downstream players and traders, of which 70 per cent are national oil companies and global firms. The remaining exposure is mainly short-term structured exposure, it added.Upstream exposure is mainly to national and international oil companies.DBS last week reported a 29 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit for the first quarter to S$1.17 billion."

They called the number of the missing phone and Othman answered the call.They traced Othman to his location at a bench nearby, at Block 166, Teck Whye Crescent.When they found their belongings with Othman, the victims asked for their items back, but Othman lied and said he had bought them from a passer-by.He asked them for S$50 in return for the items, and the victims refused. When Othman ignored them, the victims called the police.Before they arrived and arrested Othman for theft, Othman handed the stolen mobile phone to another man, whose identity could not be established.The phone was never recovered, but the other items were returned to the victims.Othman pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, with a third of absconding from court taken into consideration.The prosecutor asked for three weeks' jail, listing Othman's string of previous offences, starting with theft in 1986. His latest sentence was in 2019, for stealing two cans of beer.Othman, who was unrepresented, apologised to the judge.I'VE LOST EVERYTHING: OTHMAN\"I committed the offences because I have a reason,\" he said. \"I lost my five children, my wife. I have three daughters and two sons.\"He said his parents have both died and said he has not touched any drugs since 2014. He claimed that his flat had been repossessed and that he was \"under tremendous stress\", saying that he slept in a cemetery and did not have a single cent on him.He told the court he did not mean to steal the mobile phone.\"My clothing, my trousers, my shirt, my top, all were very smelly, my friends told me I smell very badly,\" said Othman. \"When I went into the rubbish collection centre I saw these trousers ... I really did not know there were watches ... all the watches are spoilt, your honour.\"He said he admitted his mistakes, adding that he did not intend to skip court but that he was in \"much pain\".The judge backdated his sentence to Apr 20, when he was placed in remand, meaning he will walk free on Wednesday.She repeated advice to Othman to follow up with a psychiatrist and to go to a family service centre for his accommodation and financial difficulties."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: \"I'm a traditional banker. I don't know tech. But when I landed the role, it turned out to be an enabler.” A leader who heads digital transformation at a major bank once said at a panel discussion I moderated.Had I come from a tech background, I would have operated in the realm of the possible, she added.“However, because I did not deep dive into the technology aspects, but looked at what customers wanted, I could focus on the desirable.”Her embracing of an “I don’t know” mantra struck a chord. These were not words you expect to hear from a seasoned corporate leader.This deeper lesson can be applied to many aspects of corporate life - that “I don’t know” can be powerful words that unleash focus, creativity and collaboration.The trouble is acknowledging our limitations goes against the grain of everything we have been brought up to believe.We were told to study hard to ace exams and avoid not knowing in school.When we entered the working world, we were hired, rewarded, even promoted for our knowledge and what hints of competence knowledge provides.Yet, when we take on the mantle of leadership, this quest to know everything can be counter-productive, even disempowering, in a world of constant change and rapid disruption, where adapting requires acknowledging we do not have ready-made solutions to fresh challenges.Don’t get me wrong – by no means am I advocating for ignorance or excusing lazy leadership. Yet not enough has been said about what is lost when leaders try to be subject matter experts.KNOWING CAN KILL INITIATIVE AND INNOVATIONSteve Jobs famously said: \"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.\"Yet micromanaging is everywhere. When we believe we know everything, we are unlikely to allow others to share their perspectives.This not only prevents new innovative ideas from being surfaced, but also inhibits the professional growth of people we work with.I once coached a leader who was so beholden to knowing everything she could even complete her staff’s sentences. Naturally, her team soon stopped speaking up and went along with whatever she said. Then she complained they were not proactive and did not offer any good suggestions.KNOWING BREEDS CLOSED THINKINGSteve Yeggie, Head of Engineering, Ads and Monetisation at Grab once shared that the key to fast innovation is Grab’s “go to the ground” mantra.Leaders don’t assume they know everything and so are expected to see how things work on the ground and ask questions. Grab also constantly encourages employees to get involved with Grab users, to understand customer needs amid new changes to pivot quickly, he said.When we believe we know everything, we are less likely to ask questions. We tend to talk more and listen less.While talking may clarify thinking, it is listening that helps us learn, discover more information and options, and allows us to cast a wider net of diverse solutions.HAVING TO KNOW EVERYTHING GENERATES UNDUE STRESS As an executive coach and transformation consultant, I work with many stressed-out leaders. When a digital-immigrant leader has to manage digital-native staff and steer the organisation in increasingly uncharted waters, they may inadvertently take on too much responsibility for the success of their teams instead of working in a smarter way to empower staff.As the world becomes increasingly digital, with new technologies and concepts like blockchain, artificial intelligence and cloud computing reshaping our world, leaders will lead people smarter than them, in roles that did not even exist just a few years ago.Trying to cope with this and also aiming to be domain matter experts in a dozen different disciplines can be a futile quest.For too long, we have bought into the narrative of the invincible, all-knowing leader. This style has its time and place, however, its vulnerabilities have been exposed as the world battles COVID-19 – the biggest disruption of this age.There have been leaders who opted to project a veneer of absolute knowledge and control over the situation, like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump, who were later lambasted for bungled messaging, covering up the truth and delayed responses that cost thousands of lives as the outbreak worsened. In contrast, leaders like NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who were upfront about the unknowns, and their plans to mitigate the uncertainty, managed to restore public calm and confidence.Enlightened leadership is having the courage to acknowledge we do not know everything, and the clarity that we do not need to, if we have the right team with the expertise working on it and can count on them in critical areas.PEOPLE MORE ENGAGED IF THEY CAN CONTRIBUTEFacing the impact of COVID-19, payments firm Gravity’s CEO Dan Price faced a devastating decision in late-March: Cut 20 per cent of his people or go out of business. Torn between two very tough choices he asked his employees for help.“I think bosses should always talk to their employees before making any big decisions,” Price tweeted. “They might surprise you with ideas you hadn't thought of. At the least, transparency makes everyone feel like they're in this together.”Responding to him, Gravity employees took ownership of the decision: 90 per cent offered to take a temporary pay cut, and 13 per cent were willing to cut half their pay, enabling everyone to be employed for up to a year or more.Strong leaders know asking for help holds the key to harnessing the combined strengths of their teams, and is not a sign of weakness.Research published in Harvard Business Review shows how people are most engaged when they are able to contribute. Gallup’s study on employee engagement highlights people feel more engaged when they feel their opinions count and they have opportunities to learn and grow.Yet, leaders who feel they need to have all the answers ultimately limit the contribution of the team. Instead, by asking for help, like what Price did, a leader demonstrates he values people’s expertise and creates the space for them to co-create solutions.‘I DON’T KNOW’ BRINGS OUT CREATIVITY AND INNOVATIONWhen you think of the most iconic inventions, the ones that have made the biggest impact on the human race, their starting point was not to build on existing knowledge, but to re-imagine possibilities.Life-changing inventions such as the light bulb, airplanes, even the first vaccine, were initially ridiculed. Undeterred, the inventors went against conventional knowledge.This is an important mindset needed to nurture innovative future-ready teams.While past experience is invaluable, it is also the Achilles heel for most leaders, since it can quash novel ideas and innovative thinking. It may make us pre-judge ideas.Less experienced employees are often the force behind innovation simply because they are less bogged down by what has worked.This was the breakthrough story in self-driving cars. The US government failed to get traction in the production of autonomous military vehicles by partnering with the big three auto manufacturers for five years.So the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency held an open-to-all competition for a self-driving car that could complete a course in the Mojave Desert in less than 10 hours in 2004. A team of engineering students from Stanford University won the US$2 million prize and propelled the first big push into autonomous vehicles.BEING HONEST INSPIRES TRUSTIn a world replete with information overload, authenticity is the currency of trust. Studies support this, including the Million Dollar Round Table Harmony survey which discovered that customers rank “honesty” as the most important trait for financial professionals, above “knowledge” and “delivers results”.The power of candour is further emphasised by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of cybersecurity company Red Hat. “Being open about the things I did not know actually had the opposite effect than I would have thought. It helped me build credibility.”It is vital, however, we understand that the opposite of knowing is not ignorance, but learning.Riding the “I don’t know” train can be scary. However, when we embrace our curiosity in people and things, we tap into a courage to fully unleash the power of not knowing.This invites people to jump in with us. It enables us to fully leverage the power of the collective genius, creativity and passion of teams."

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Suicide rates in Singapore were reported to be 8.36 deaths per 100,000 Singapore residents last year.According to the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), this is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 to 29.  This is a 10 per cent increase from 2017.There is a high chance that the figures will continue to rise.While the effects of COVID-19 on the collective mental health have yet to be studied systematically, psychosocial repercussions of the pandemic are already felt worldwide.The US saw a 338 per cent increase in call volume to the Disaster Distress Helpline, a sub-network of America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, in March compared to the previous month.Researchers Lu Dong and Jennifer Bouey from the RAND Corporation found that China has reported “a heightened public mental health crisis” sparked by the outbreak despite emergency psychological crisis interventions proposed by the National Health Commission of China.In Singapore, organisations such as SOS, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and Fei Yue Community Services have seen spikes in the number of people calling in the last month seeking assistance for distress.  The SOS reported that it received 3,826 calls in March, 23 per cent more than it received during the same month last year.GAPS IN OUR MENTAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMAnd yet our response to mental health remains inadequate.Gaps in our mental healthcare system were brought up even before COVID-19 led to the circuit breaker period. Accessibility, affordability and inclusiveness of professional services were particularly highlighted during the Parliamentary debate on the Ministry of Health’s budget in March.We also face a lack of trained professionals. The national average of 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists for every 100,000 people in Singapore is lower than the 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 recorded by most OECD countries.Mental health support offered at the national level did not seem to keep up in tandem with the increasing numbers of those seeking help.Singapore’s total expenditure on mental health made up only 3 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s operating expenditure for 2017, according to latest data shared by the Health Minister in Parliament in 2019.The insufficient level of resources ploughed into mental health in the past could come back to haunt us. Neither the Resilience Budget nor the Solidarity Budget allocated any resources towards mental healthcare support or research.It also took three full weeks after the circuit breaker first started to declare allied health services - including private counselling and social work - as essential services, thus allowing them to remain open.Even if slightly late, this move shows that the Government recognises the impact this pandemic could have on mental health, as does its establishment of the National Care Hotline. More than 6,600 people have already called the hotline within two weeks of its launch on Apr 10.According to media reports, there were also a few callers with suicidal tendencies, with police dispatched to tend to two cases.But the same shortage of resources can be seen with how the 24-hour hotline is currently run, with about 500 volunteers from government agencies, registered mental health professionals, Social Service Agency-nominated psychologists, counsellors/social workers or personnel who are trained in psychological first aid. From the 500, about 20 to 25 of them are rostered daily to provide emotional and psychological support to callers.This small group of trained professionals daily may not be able to keep up with an increasing volume of people seeking mental health assistance.NEED FOR A COLLECTIVE RESPONSE Perhaps, rather than point out the shortcomings of our system, we need to develop an approach where all of us can play a part in protecting the mental health of our society.As an editor of a book consolidating perspectives from across the ground - from academics, organisational leaders and practising professionals, to individuals with lived experiences and supporting figures - I have found strong commonality in the belief that addressing mental health should go beyond the confines of the social services and government.We have to take steps to give mental health as much priority as physical health for ourselves and those around us.This can help shift mental healthcare into a more preventive approach, thus alleviating some of the burden on the thin level of resources we can access.Rethinking the role of mental health in our lives will enable us to work hand-in-hand with those on the policy front to forge ways to create and maintain mental health support - similar to a community-based care for medical treatment recommended by medical journal The Lancet, with “psychosocial treatments such as talking therapies being offered not just by medical professionals but also by community health workers, peers, teachers and the clergy”.Everyone has a stake in the state of our collective mental health.NORMALISING MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATIONSFor this to happen, mental health issues have to first be more normalised. For starters, we need to openly talk about the challenges we may be currently facing.It is a traumatic period with a protracted disruption to life for every individual. Social isolation offers no relief from uncertainty, fear and anxiety, and can in fact be a contributing factor. For some, it is a strain on family ties and relationships. For those in abusive domestic conditions, it can be a matter of life and death. For those susceptible to mental health issues, COVID-19 can have serious effects on their health and recovery.It is not the time to downplay feelings of fear and anxiety. It is the time to ensure you have a support system and find coping mechanisms. It is the time to reach out to others without shame when you find yourself unable to cope.It is also not the time to call out on anyone who is experiencing mental distress or conditions in any form. Be careful about your language when speaking to others. It is easy to project personal distress upon others unconsciously, even if it is not your intention.That is easier said than done. Despite national campaigns to create awareness, the stigma against mental health is still a large hindrance to tackling the issue. Various studies conducted in Singapore capture a pervasive negative attitude towards mental health conditions. One such survey by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018 found that six in 10 people believe such conditions are caused by a lack of self-discipline and will-power, while up to 50 per cent of respondents would not give people with mental health conditions any responsibility.There is also evidence of the impact stigma has on seeking treatment and recovery. Statistics show a treatment gap of up to nine years for those experiencing mood disorders while 78.4 per cent choose not to even seek help for what they experience.Reasons vary from the fear of being judged and being seen as weak, to losing autonomy and control over their lives.Unlike physical ailments, mental health conditions are not visible. What is visible - the behavioural manifestations of disorders leaning towards severity - tend to break established social norms. Those who do not know what is happening may then internalise the behaviour as threats.Mental health conditions are complex, individualistic and heterogeneous in nature.They also don’t have to be permanent.There are actions we can take to support others. We can proactively question labels. We can have more discourse around mental health issues. We can learn to listen without putting forth our own judgements or offer solutions.We can also remember that we are all susceptible to it, if we do not take steps towards mental resilience.There is an urgency to start. We may not feel the strain on our already thinning mental health resources until it’s too late.While the mental toll of COVID-19 has yet to be recorded or tracked, there is enough evidence of the profound and pervasive impact all around the world.That includes us. If we do not step up now to take mental health seriously, we will be looking at another health crisis sooner than we expect.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramXiangyun Lim is the editor of White, a book that brings together perspectives from organisational leaders, academics, practising professionals and individuals for the first time in Singapore (available August 2020).

      "para": "SINGAPORE: Singapore residents will be given \"better\" reusable face masks towards the end of the \"circuit breaker\" period, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Wednesday (May 6). This will be Singapore's third nationwide distribution of masks, and the cloth face coverings will have better bacterial filtration capabilities.The Government gave four surgical face masks to each household in February, following this up with a distribution of reusable cloth masks last month.Residents will be able to collect their new masks at community centres and residents' committee centres.For the first time, people will also be able to collect their masks from vending machines that will operate even after work hours. Authorities will share more details at a later date, said Mr Chan.Singapore started producing and stockpiling its own reusable cloth masks in February, Mr Chan told reporters, and with research and development, “new and better” materials have been found to improve on the initial cloth mask designs. Responding to questions about the decision to distribute another round of reusable masks, Mr Chan said: “Actually all the while we have planned on the distribution of the reusable masks because we know that after we distribute the first one, beyond a certain time, we will need to refresh some of these.“And as with all the reusable masks, even though it is reusable, it is not reusable for eternity. Beyond a certain point in time, people do change their masks.” The new reusable masks have better bacterial filtration “without compromising on breathability”, said Professor Alfred Huan from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). “In the earlier version, the focus was more about protecting the community from each of the wearers, and depending on the kind of cloth or material, reusability would vary quite a bit. And it wasn’t really tested for any kind of bacterial filtration at that point.” When asked if Singaporeans should stop using the reusable masks that were distributed last month, Prof Huan responded that they “would still be effective” in preventing the wearer's droplets from being transmitted outwards. “The second-generation masks have added bacterial filtration. So obviously, if someone is concerned about walking into an area where there is potentially a lot of viral load, then he could be using that second mask, and it will be more effective in offering him some way of protection.“I hesitate to give any clear examples of whether you should be still using the first-generation masks. But the principle by which it's stopping community spread, I think the first generation masks are useful. (They) can still be used as long as you know there are no tears and wear of the fabric.”Noting research by A*STAR that shows the reusable cloth masks protect people by preventing saliva and droplets from infecting others, Mr Chan said: “That strategy of using a cloth mask works if all of us mask up together.” A*STAR is working with local textile and apparel manufacturer Ramatex to produce the new reusable face masks, they said in a joint media release on Wednesday, adding that production began in April. The masks can be hand washed with mild detergent and fully air-dried. \"This can be done up to 30 times while maintaining its integrity,\" they added. The breathability of the masks was also optimised to be comparable with medical masks.In addition, the mask's duck beak design reduces the components needed, such as the metal nose bridge typically found in disposable masks, said the agency.  LOCAL PRODUCTION OF SURGICAL MASKSThe local production of surgical masks was also restarted in February, Mr Chan said, with the help of Innosparks at ST Engineering.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore was only involved in the production of N95 masks.For surgical masks, Singapore typically works with overseas partners to produce them. The country always had plans in place in the event that a supplier is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations, Mr Chan said.When one foreign supplier was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations during the COVID-19 outbreak, the local production capabilities for surgical masks were restarted, he added.With export restrictions constantly changing amid the coronavirus pandemic, diversifying and looking for new supply lines was a “daily exercise”. “I must give credit to many of the workers working behind the scenes. It’s really their tenacity and creativity that allowed them to bring back the masks to Singapore,” said Mr Chan.For example, some purchasers had to visit other countries and factories overseas, pay for the masks in cash, and guard the masks to make sure they are loaded on the trailers, planes and ships, he added. The locally produced surgical masks will go towards Singapore’s healthcare system.Surgical masks available to the public will continue to be sourced from multiple countries, said Mr Chan. While the Trade and Industry Minister declined to share the exact production capacity for masks, the Government is confident in supplying the masks for local healthcare needs “for quite some time”. Mr Gareth Tang, who heads Innosparks, said the team’s aim is to eventually supply masks for the whole healthcare system, and it is “largely on track” to do that. “We have started mask fitting exercises at the hospitals at the frontline, and started forwarding our goods to the frontline as well.” Thanking businesses and small and medium enterprises who came forward to offer help to start production lines in Singapore, Mr Chan said: “The common challenge for all of us in this pandemic is to make sure that we are able to secure the raw materials (for the masks).” "
